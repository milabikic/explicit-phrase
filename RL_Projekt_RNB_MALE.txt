And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away

You mean so much to me
In my world, in my world
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archer's bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Keep em high y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me
Beautiful

Burn
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through

Charlene
Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
To hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold
She must have told me a thousand times before
Silent cries I use to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things
But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
Promise I can't live without her
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone
I pray that she'll come back one day
In my life
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
Oh oh oh
Sometimes I cry
Charlene if you're listening would you call on me
Because my heart is aching

Find a Way
It used to be, we would be the best of all friends
It turned to be L O V E and I was your man
So you was my lady-friend, we spent time
I found a way to be by your side
Through the ins and outs, the wrongs and rights
After a while of bein' settled down, I didn't know how to keep the love
'cause I was young, I wish I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't let you go, I swear I would've made this love grow
I spent a lot of time and a lot of dough
Tryin' to match what we had and now I, I
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
Wish that I would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know until you left, I loved your smile
Just the other day your girl said that you can't stand me
I know you don't mean that
Can't we just slow down a minute and talk it out?
I've been through my share of love since then
Don't know about what you've been through
But nothin' compares to what we had
All I know is I need you back and I know that you need me back
Baby, let's try again to find our love
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
I can't forget the times we shared
Didn't know love until love was gone
'Til I moved on
Now I'm right back to square one again
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
Find our love, baby
Find our love, baby

Sweet melody, wind up your body 'pon mi
Your lovin' baby girl, you know mi need it, need it
Let me fight for it, me achieve it, 'chieve it
Feel my love drip over your skin
Rich dark chocolate, sweet melanin
Forevermore you gon' be my kin
Whatever jaw has binded, let no man enter in

Still
It's been a long time since we last spoke
I still wonder what you're up to
After all the shit we've been through
And I've been spending a lot of time drinking and smoking
Hoping to subdue
The thought of you in my head
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questioning what is he doing
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
It still hurts
There's been a lot of nights when I feel alone
Needed someone to talk to
'Cause I just need to get through
And I've been spending a lot of money
On things that I don't need
Hoping that I'll feel new
But I can't get you out my head
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questioning what is he doing
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain (girl, I've been trying to find a way)
Since you've been away (a way that I can numb this pain)
I don't wanna feel anymore (I don't wanna feel)
And there's probably people telling you
That I'm doing fine (I'm just tryna get you outta my head)
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
It still hurts

Killing Me
You
You
Why, do I depend on you?
6 then I'm 'bout to pull up
Think 'bout your body too much
I'm feeling you for real
Missin' the party for what?
There ain't nobody but us
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through (uh)
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right you're killing me
That's right you're killing me
Adrenaline gentlemen, baby
Skeletons that I don't hold back
Try to stop, do you feel relaxed?
Love it when you make me feel like that
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through (uh)
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, you're killing me
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, you're killing me
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right, that's right (ooh, ooh-ooh)
That's right, that's right, that's right (ooh, ooh-woah)
That's right, that's right, that's right

For some time

You ain't on my mind
Been tryna give it some time
Feelin' like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say
I can say that lovin' you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than try to understand
Mornin' sun, mornin' high
Oh, I think this haze is for now my best disguise
No need to think about why
What'cha say, starry-eyed
How you love to smile
And watch the clouds reside
Just tryna give it some time

Clouded
That shit definitely broke
Gotta get it how you live, you know?
Everybody talkin' 'bout R&B shit
I'm just talkin' me shit
You know what I mean?
Let me hear that
I gave it all for a fantasy
Is anybody gon' remember me?
If I go tonight, I doubt the world'll change
I just pray they don't forget my name
These are game rules, I can't lose
When it's all said and done, will I still be cool?
Spent like (how much?)
Ten thousand (ten thousand)
Twenty thousand (twenty thousand)
Thirty thousand (thirty thousand)
Forty thousand (forty thousand)
How much I'ma spend profilin'?
She come in and compliment my closet
Fuck her on the floor like I don't give a fuck 'bout it
Your judgement get clouded when you clouted
My opposition wish I'd stop smilin'
My family wish I'd stop wildin'
I'm still on the east side smokin' with my OG's
'Cause they the only ones that really know me
I was fuckin' superstars when I was nineteen (hmm)
The shit we did, you won't believe me
Now I'm at the turn up, lookin' lonely
Then they wonder why I'm quiet at them house parties
'Cause everybody see me (see me)
Roll some blunts and hit her once and now she need me (need me)
Her nigga wanna be me (yeah)
But they don't know I'm fightin' demons
I feel like dyin' every season
I've been swimmin' in the deep end
All my bitches know I'm leavin' at some point (mm, I'm out)
Whether there's a reason or not
Don't try givin' me reasons to stop

Easily
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
We had a good thing going lately
Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know
That they ain't real
I'll take the truth over the story
You might've tried my patience lately
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do something for me?
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Coming and going
Inside out
Back to front
All tangled and messy
That's how we've been and we'll always be
And that's alright with me
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

69 Camaro
'69 Camaro, put it into drive
Got it painted red and white
Still seeing blue and reds
Swear they want a nigga dead
These people with the cameras ain't no friend of mine, no
Never smile in my photos
Penthouse view downtown
Owed up, what that bank look like?
Extended all my credit lines
Hear a lot of noise coming out your mouth
I get wilted roses from the crowd
Bet you bought a ticket just so you could say you
Saw it when the shit went down
Where that nigga at now?
Now you got your wishes, had to sell the whiz kid
People say I'm falling
Used to be the man, now the man's down (man's down)
How did I get so caught up?
Why even try? Try to defy?
I'm the type to press my luck
Why fall in line? I don't care no more, no more
Feel a little woozy, can't stand now (oh)
Everybody's smiling, got their hands outside
Don't know how to keep dry
Hear a lot of noise coming out your mouth
(Coming out your mouth, baby)
They throw wilted roses from the crowd
And I'm sure you bought yourself a ticket just so you could say you
Saw it when the shit went down
Where that nigga at now?
Well you got your wishes, I lost my position
People say I'm falling (people say I'm falling)
Used to be the man, now the man's down
(The man's down, yeah, the man's down) man's down (ah)
Ooh, whoa, nah-nah (ah)
Ooh, you only hit me up
When shit is going down, down, down (going down, down, down)
Why they don't want me around? (Ah)
Down, down

Silence
Silence
Silence could be the best conversation
Cause baby, I've been thinking so much about that lately
My lady, I'm on my knees

Cause I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you (ooh yeah)
I'm lost, I'm lost without you
(Ooh yeah)
Inner peace
You should come and show me what it means to ya
Possession
A livelihood of you keeping all you need for ya
My lady, I care for you so loosely
So show me where I need to be
Cause I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you (ooh yeah)
I'm lost, I'm lost without you
(Ooh yeah)
It's love, love, love (mhmm)
Oh it's love, love, love (oh yeah)
It's love, love, love (mhmm)
Oh It's love, love, love (oh yeah)
Lost without you (ooh yeah)

Miss Summer
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time, living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Every night, I recall this same love (on and on again)
Although my dreams are all she's made of (on and on again)
Like a truce to be made
There's two sides to the pain
Pray I choose right anyway
Wired to chasе love
Wipe my tears in thе face of death
No need for a chaser
Hoping the moment don't fade 'til I'm high again
Focus on mine, keep faith, and we'll fly again
Love, at least I can when you're right here
I know the feeling might change when the night ends
Unless the world stops for you, but
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on again
