Early Morning Breeze
I open up my door to greet the early morning sun
Closing it behind me and away I do run
To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees
To have a word with God in the early morning breeze
A rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze

Jackson Ain’t a Very Big Town
Tonight at night we get married my friends all say it's a shame and disgrace
And he's loved every woman in Jackson oh but Jackson ain't a very big place
Tomorrow we'll go walking I count each one with a tear on her face
Then I'll know just how many think I'm lucky cause Jackson ain't a very big place
Jackson is a mighty small town where the gossips and the rumors go round
But the gossips are the ones he turned down and Jackson ain't a very big town
Jackson is a mighty small town

Gunpowder And Lead
County road two thirty-three under my feet
Nothin' on this white rock but little ol' me
I've got two miles 'til he makes bail
And if I'm right, we're headed straight for hell
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead
Well, it's half past ten, another six-pack in
And I can feel the rumble like the cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waiting here this time
Hey, I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead
His fist is big, but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and, gunpowder and lead
Gunpowder and lead, yeah, yeah
Hey


You're Supposed To Be Feeling Good
Soulmate, I see you down there
Waiting for morning to softly be coming
I find I'm only in deeper and you'd be a leaver
If you weren't so scared
Your true love has made you feel better
But look out for later when she makes you feel worse
Times change in daydreams and flashes
A taste of the past is all I have seen
But you're supposed to be feeling good now
'Cause everybody said you would
Honey, does it blow your mind that the prophets would lie?
Well, you're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Feeling like you're down and out over someone like me
Soulmate, the blues are deceiving
It keeps us believing we're on the wrong road
One side is just like the other
Except for the color and size of the load
And just how much it shows
But you're supposed to be feeling good now
'Cause everybody said you would
Oh honey, does it blow your mind that the prophets would lie?
You're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Just feeling like you're down and out over someone like me


Don’t Call Me
If you get yourself in another one of your binds
Run for help, yell for someone, pray for a sign
Dial 911, light a roadside flare
Up and run, I don't care
Just don't, don't call me
If your truck breaks down, if it all falls apart
Leave it on the shoulder, just get out, take a walk
If your shoes hurt your feet, take 'em off
Probably do ya some good, hell, maybe a lot
Just don't, don't call me
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
If you wake up in jail and they let you use the phone
Even if mine's the only number you know
You gotta figure it out on your own
You used up your favours a long time ago
So don't, well don't call me
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
Oh no you don't!
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
Oh you don't call me
don't call me!
(Pick up a book and get self help) that's right, you don't call me!
(1800, go to hell, there's always been someone else) don't call me!
No, no, no (you can lean on your other ex)
(I know y'all still text) don't call me!
(Call your mom, she'll fix your mess) don't call me!
(Call your doctor!) You don't call me!
(Your lawyer if you can afford one) don't call me!
(Lose my number, don't call Brandi, and don't call me)
don't call me
(Your tattoo artist; somebody else can get this party started)

Greener Pasture
Ooh oh ooh
I'm sittin' on the front porch, cigarette burnin'
Them makers in my coffee sure ain't workin'
I see the dirt from where his boots used to lay
Still phantom pains after a couple a days
And I wonder if he ever thought about turnin' around
Bet he's past El Paso by now
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture (ooh)
Bet he's rollin' through a new town, and she's fallin' for his accent
She don't know that he's a dust cloud, he's beautifully tragic
He stays for the night, but he's gone by the morning
Let him ruin your life like a Tennessee storm
And this shouldn't tear you up, break you down this bad
Lovin' something you never had
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture
And all that ever mattered, livin' hard and livin' faster
Freedom was a dagger to a knife holder
There ain't no ever after, you're special, then you're shattered
Damn, he's got a way of leavin' his mark
Yeah, I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture (ooh)
But cowboys always find a greener pasture

Still Under The Weather
My first lesson losing a love was you
Learning to live with your memory was lesson number two
I can't lie, baby
I still cry sometimes
But I've come a long way
Towards gettin' you out of my mind
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
I still miss the shelter
Of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me
Has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
Sometimes your memory still gets the best of me
But that lonely ache in my heart
Ain't as bad as it used to be
Sometimes the way that I'm feelin'
Inside doesn't show
But I know
I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
And I still miss the shelter
Of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me
Has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm

Dooley's Farm
Old Dooley was raised Carolina
Got his schoolin' out in Vietnam
Tucks his hair up in a Pioneer seed cap
When he's bringing his cash crop in
Everybody said he's just a simpleton farmer
Plow a hundred acres out in Sugar Grove
Smilin' at you from an IH tractor
But there's a secret down in every row
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
Old Dooley's got a roadside farm stand
Sweet corn, tomatoes, and turnip greens
But if you ask to buy a jug of sorghum
He'll know exactly what you mean
He'll meet you in the back of the woods at midnight
Bring a lantern cause it's hard to find
He's got a strain that'll punch your lights out
Old Dooley's gonna blow your mind
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
You can hide by day but the night will find you
They caught Dooley in the moonlight
Drug him down from the field to the state farm
To bust rocks on the roadside
Now everybody says I'm just a simpleton farmer
But they don't know that I'm an outlaw
Growing green must've ran in the family
Cause old Dooley is my grandpa
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco then they made moonshine
But there's something better in the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco then they made moonshine
But there's something better in the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm

Your Drinkin', My Problem
Four a.m., stumbled to the bedroom again
'Cause I know where you're goin', you won't say where you've been
It was the bloodshot eyes that gave it away
Yeah, it's never my tab but I always pay
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Must be nice sleepin' 'til 11 o'clock like a rock
You lie to my face, not an ounce of shame in your walk
Oh, for the sake of my health, let's say that we're done
'Cause I feel like hell every time you get drunk
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Well, you can count me out for your next round
'Cause your livin' it up is bringin' me down
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
Yeah, I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Yeah, I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Yeah, my problem

The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said, "Hello"
He said, "Hi, what's new?"
And Wo said, "Sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt"
Said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth"
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself"
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home 'cause he didn't live far, you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot, just to flag 'em down
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?"
The judge said "guilty" on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said, "Supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it"
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister don't miss when she aims her gun
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Give It Time
I was going through the drawer at an old antique store
When a note on a page caught my eye
Words, they were sad, made my insides feel bad
Like it spoke from the man that I adore
He was moving on, he spent most of his nights gone
And I knew our love was ending
To this very day, I still get tears in my eyes
For the words that he never said
Give it time, write some letters
Give it time, you'll feel better
Soon I will fade from your mind
Give it time, no more sleepless nights
Give it time, you'll find the one that's right
You think that you still need me, give it time
And if you think that it won't last
You're probably just livin' in the past
And if you need someone to help you get through the night
Go out there, go ahead, find the light
And if you need some place to go, you're with me we'll go slow
To this very day, I still get tears in my eyes
For the words that he never said
Give it time, write some letters
Give it time, you'll feel better
Soon I will fade from your mind
Oh, give it time, no more sleepless nights
Give it time, you'll find the one that's right
You think that you still need me, just give it time

Hard As This
If you need space Take a trip Hijack you a ride on a rocket ship Hang out with the constellations Get yourself some isolation babe 
If you need time Here's a clock You can sit alone at night and listen to it tic and toc When it stops just wind it up 
I'll be somewhere giving up on you All my love is wasted on nothin but a heart ache in my chest You know how much 
I hate it Cause baby your the one who does it best Love shouldn't be so hard Hard as this If you need to think 
Read a book Read about some thief Stealing hearts like a crook See yourself there in the plot 
Realize you've got a lot to lose All my love is wasted on nothin but a heart ache in my chest You know how much 
I hate it Cause baby your the one who does it best Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard Hard as this 
All my love is wasted on nothin but a heart ache in my chest 
But honey you'll be aching to Cause I might be the one that you'll regret
Oh I coulda been the one for you but Lately I don't know what we got left Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard
Oh love shouldn't be so hard Hard as this

I Can't Love You Anymore
Shoulda known what I was getting in
Fallin' for a boy from Michigan
You love your mom like every Midwest kid
You like driving to Texas
You put up with all my exes
To deserve you, don't know what the hell I did
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
Bring me coffee every morning
You're fun even when you're boring
And you like me even when I've been a bitch
You watch me while I'm gettin' ready
You lighten up my heavy
You're so good lookin' it kinda makes me sick
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk you down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now, aye, aye
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You're the angel to my devil
The pot to my kettle
To some I might be an acquired taste
You tell me I'm your favorite person
Hey, what we've got is working
And the years have only made it more that way
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
Heaven knows that I've attempted
Couldn't even put a dent in
I can't love you any more than I do now

Heart Like A Truck
I never stay in one place too long
A dirt road's singing me a siren song
I gotta find a field
I need to spin my wheels
I got a hankering for four wide tires
And I can't help it it's the way I'm wired
'Fore you get too close
Boy you need to know
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
There ain't no breaking when I throw it in drive
Don't always keep it in between the lines
If you're ready for a ride pedal down state of mind
Boy I tell you what
You better buckle up
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
Go on and see if you can knock off the dust yea
Shine it up revv it up and let it run yea
It gets a high riding off into the sun yea
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline

A little bit of love is all that it's needing

Truth No. 2
You don't like the sound of the truth
Comin' from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well, baby that might be so
I might get to the end of my life
Find out everyone was lyin'
I don't think that I'm afraid anymore
Say that I would rather die tryin'
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
This time when he swung the bat
And I found myself layin' flat I wondered
What a way to spend a dime
What a way to use the time, ain't it baby?
I looked at my reflection in the window walkin' past
And I saw a stranger
Just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
Why the world's dangerous
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
You don't like the sound of the truth
Comin' from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well, baby that might be so
Tell me what's wrong with havin' a little faith
In what you're feeling in your heart
Why must we be so afraid
And always so far apart?
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips

Big Family
It's bunk beds and matching sheets
Sharin' the bathroom sink
Fist fightin' over window seats all the way to KOA
It's more cousins than we have friends
A piggyback pyramid to fit us all in
And squintin' through a Polaroid lens on Thanksgiving Day
We learned how to ration apple pie
And how to dirty dance when Aunt Tina had too much wine
It's all husbands and ex-wives and boyfriends and pink lines
And the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family
It's "Hurry up" and "Wait your turn" and
Eat it all even if it's burned
It don't take too long to learn that the world don't revolve around you
We're a picture frame patchwork
Roots tangled in the same dirt
Little baggage, little hard work
It's all worth its weight
In husbands and ex-wives and boyfriends and pink lines
And the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family, ooh
Big family
We're thick skinned and stubborn
'Til the day we're six feet under
It's the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family, ooh
Big family, yeah
Big family

Matches and Metaphors
It's raining at my house, is it raining at yours?
When it rains it pours, to hell with the metaphors.
I want you so bad I think I might die
I'm sorry I keep feeding you these lines, but
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
I wrote you a letter. I threw it in the trash.
Got it out lit it with a match.
I'm not gonna tell you how I feel,
It's overrated but damn, it's real
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
If you don't want me, that don't bother me at all.
Don't be upset if I don't answer when you call.
Maybe I can move on, but there was nothing to move on from.
My veins are on fire, babe my face is numb
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
It's raining at my house, is it raining at yours

I've Been Loving You Too Long
I've been loving you too long to stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me
I've been loving you, a little too long
I don't wanna stop now
With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, our affair grows old
I've been loving you much too long
To stop now
I've been loving you much too long
I don't wanna stop now
Oh, please don't make me stop now
Oh, please I can't stop now
I've been loving you too long

Merry Go 'Round
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday mornin', you best be there
In the front row like you're supposed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary quite contrary
We get bored, so we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
We think the first time's good enough
So, we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want, it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction
'Cause mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored, so, we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

Back in Baby’s Arms
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Don't know why we quarrel
We never did before
Since we found out how it hurt
I bet we never quarrel anymore
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Thought I didn't need his love
Till he took it away
Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms

If Trouble Comes a Lookin’
What is there in Little Rock at the Hilton Double Tree
Just a woman far from home a thousand miles out to sea
She walks over to the window, pulls the curtain shut
Pours three fingers of whiskey in a flimsy plastic cup
Sits down on the bedspread, takes off her wedding ring
If she does something dark enough he might just set her free
It's her mother's mother's diamond in a shining golden band
Another woman who spent most her life loving the wrong man
If trouble comes a' lookin' she won't be hard to find
She's sitting in the hotel bar on her second glass of wine
She put a pretty dress on, wiped the tears out of her eyes
And if trouble comes a'lookin she won't be hard to find
Just two floors down is Brother John from Our Lady of Grace
He is older now but handsome still with such a lonely face
He picked a hotel off the Interstate where even God won't find him
Runs his fingers through the rosary and locks the door behind him
How was Christ so perfect, how on earth did he resist
The perfume on a woman's neck, the softness of her lips
He burned and burned for years with the fire of devotion
But some things are impossible to stop once they're in motion
If trouble comes a'lookin' he won't be hard to find
He's sitting in the hotel bar on his second glass of wine
Across the empty room he glances up to meet her eyes
And if trouble comes a lookin' he won't be hard to find
At quarter til the bartender will make the final call
She'll slip down off her stool and sway slowly down the hall
And he'll kiss her like she always wanted, back against the wall
And she'll step out of her dress looking like Eve before the fall
If trouble comes a lookin they won't be hard to find
They're tangled in each other's arms in room 229
They've never strayed this far into the shadows of the night
And if trouble comes a' lookin' they won't be hard to find
Not every infidelity is bound to end in shame
She'll smile one month later when a letter bears his name
Brother John has gone to France and Italy to travel
Where all of his ideas of God will happily unravel

Red Dress
Last night I ached and pleaded for candlelight and you
Walked the floor 'til midnight and cried ’til half past two
Then you come in with a flimsy grin and a flimsier excuse
With your shirt just reeking of cheap perfume and stale vermouth
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get me a new red dress and go out and paint the town
Get out on the dance floor, strut them curves around
And we’ll just see who thinks that I'm a ragged hand me down
Lately when you look at me, you been seeing a trinity
Your mama, the Irish washer woman and a whore from gay Paree
But I'm from Enid, Oklahoma and my name is not Marie
And I don't like the aroma of your third hand ecstasy
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get my new red dress and go out and paint the town
Hem line slit high on the thigh, lots of cleavage to bounce around
And we'll just see who thinks that I'm a ragged hand me down
I don’t like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I’m gonna get my new red dress and go out and paint the town
I just got one life to live and then I'm six feet under ground
And I don’t think I'm gonna live it as a ragged hand me down
You'll have to wash your own shirts now and hang 'em out on your line of balderdash
Take your hot stuff and your pickup truck down to First Street and pay cash
I ain’t the socket for your rocket, babe, I ain't your playtime clown
And I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get me a new red dress and go out and paint the town
Gonna find someone to love me and what's in that scarlet gown
Someone who knows there's a lot more in it than a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna find someone to love me and what's in that scarlet gown
Someone who knows there's a lot more in it than a ragged hand me down

Sober & Skinny
Oh-oh-oh
Wow-oh-oh-oh
I empty the fridge
You empty the bottle
We're stacking up a mountain of hard pills
We'll have to swallow
It's strange how we point
I've lost it one another
We both got different vices
And they lead us to each other
Cause you owe the drink and I over eat
We're under thinking everything
And every night we swear it's gonna change
But in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Write the checks that we can cash
Keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (hmm-mmm)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (yeah, mmm)
You want being a shrink
While I think we should talk to one
Find a comfy couch and let out all the hurt
We've kept inside since we were young
That's so numb
Now we found ways to cover up
If we keep going out
We're going while we become
Cause in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Writing checks that we can cash
An keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, oh, oh
It's easy to imagine, imagine
All our problems disappear like magic, magic
But even on this world
You're not sober, I'm not skinny
We scraping by old borrowed pennies
Writing checks that'll never cash
Breaking all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
Maybe we'll grow old together
Waking up by our happy ending
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh, oh)
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
You'll get sober, I'll get skinny
It's easy to imagine
It's easy to imagine

Promises, Promises
You've promised you would be true to me but we both know you could never be
You've been puttin' you on since the day we met
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Then you promised me a ring a weddin' gown and all of them things
But I ain't seen no diamond yet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met you break my heart in two again I'll bet
But promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
And now you tell me you've gone away you swear to me that this time you'll stay
But I can't believe that I'm rid of you yet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met you break my heart in two again I'll bet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met...

He Wasn't Man Enough
Darkchild
Oh, yeah, yeah
Ha-ha, uh-huh
Yeah, uh, uh
Darkchild, yeah

Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first?

What you thinkin'?
Stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance

And not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worryin' about me
And hopefully you won't find
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

What you thinkin'?
Stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance
See, I've already had your man

I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me

Oh yeah
So many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change
Girl, you better recognize the game, oh yeah

What are you thinking?

When It Rains It Pours
Sunday morning, man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinkin' that her leavin'
Is the only logical reason
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Springsteen
To this day, when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut off jeans
Somewhere between that settin' sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
We were just gettin' started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh"
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you
I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
Still be a spark
And back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what would mama think
'Bout your name on my arms
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound, roll the beat of a drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear "Born in the USA"
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me
Do you think about 17?
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky?
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Oh, Springsteen

Barefoot Blue Jean Night
A full moon shinin' bright
Edge of the water, we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and an old guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught up in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Whoa-oh, never gonna grow up, ha
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night

Head Over Boots
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah
So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
Yeah, I'm here to pick you up
And I hope I don't let you down, no, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll

Drunk On A Plane
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
Hmm, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim, hmm
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane

Toes
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther
I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for Tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play
The four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid goodbye to my friends
Because my bartender she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the Rum
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the people they call me Big Poppa
When I throw pesos their way
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jäger
And I'll grab my guitar and play
Going home now to stay
The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to stay
Going home now to stay
And put my ass in a lawn chair
Toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
Life is good today
Life is good today

Do I Make You Wanna
Baby what's on your mind?
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can get lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind?
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now

Girl, when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Karaoke in the neon light
Go to Vegas, stay up all night
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little seven, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show?
Or maybe just stay low?
I gotta know now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now
Act just like you don't care now
Girl when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now?
We can take it back downtown

Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find

Play a little truth or dare now
Act just like you don't care now
Girl when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon? Broadway?
Tell me do I make you wanna
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
(Let your hair down)
Yeah (Play a little truth or dare now)
Ye-e-yeah-eh (Act just like you don't care now)
Baby
Go flyin' down a two lane road
A limb to hang your clothes on (Oh)
Huh babe, tell me do I make you wanna

Wagon Wheel
Headin' down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-gettin' me down
Lost my money playin' poker, so I had to leave town
But I ain't a-turnin' back to livin' that old life no more
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Yeah, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke
But he's a-headin' west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I died in Raleigh, at least I will die free
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Oh, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel (oh, I wanna feel)
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me

Girl Like You
Love how you close your eyes
When I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah, you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top

Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you

Hometown Girl
She grew up around here on that southwest side
Where the corn grows up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night
She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot where she came from
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl


Tennessee Whiskey
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

Knockin’ Boots
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me across town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey

Last calls needa call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

Speakers, Bleachers And Preachers
You had a blue jean jacket, a burned CD
Said you wanna go somewhere fast with me
I picked you up
Yeah, and we turned it up
You had a broke heart necklace
Post-game smile
J Town front page news for awhile
Then we broke up
But I still turned it up
Cheerleading skirts and backseats
Free throws and church marquees
Kingsley countdown radio
Wouldn't know nothing if it weren't for all those
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss
The faster the car, more money you burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Story of my youth
Speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growin' up to do
Kroger parkin' lot, battle scars
Black and Mild on the dash under the stars
If Daddy asks they ain't mine
82 degrees on the bank sign
And hey, hey, summer jams
Any Chesney song gonna make her dance
When the sun goes down, yeah
I'll think about her now
And all those
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss

Story of my youth
Speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growin' up to do
Subs from my system
Rattlin' my rearview
Used to listen with my cousin
I miss him, he's gone now
It was the national anthem
And a knee-down prayer we were actin'
Like we weren't just like every other small town
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss
The faster the car, more money you burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers

The Way I Talk
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it, them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheering on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man, it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Yeah it's, Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now
Fighting words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact, I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know
I sound a little bit like my daddy
I don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

Loud and Heavy
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Pistons pumping
Minds are racing
It's hard to sleep, man
When I'm shaking
Bad news surrounds me
It's always found me
Creeping up when things are good
Yeah, the dark days find a way
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
The camra captures
All the things that
Make us turn from
What we see
It's always moving
It don't stop rolling
I haven't slept in three damn days
Yeah, but who needs that anyway?
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Loud thunder heavy rain
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
A long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Loud thunder heavy rain

Plain to See Plainsman
I cut through the Rockies like some unholy blade
The icy depths of the Pacific I have bade
Forever I wander, forever I stray
The rustle of wheat fields starts callin' my name
Callin' my name
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home
Well the North-folk are dandy, they don't mind the cold
The South has filled up both my belly and soul
I know when I'm gray and I know when I'm old
These bones will cry out for the place they were born
Place they were born
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home
I've met beautiful women, a pleasure to see
Road-bitten bikers and barefoot hippies
Junkies and saints on my travels I greet
But far too few are homesick young plainsmen like me
Plainsmen like me
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home


I Love This Life
I love my boots broke in, I love my Camo hat
Don't mind a little paint on my jeans, yeah I roll like that
I love driving my truck across the railroad tracks
If you hit it too quick, it'll hit ya right back
I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on
How it shines like gold when the sun turned on
I love the sound of them wheels with my baby singing along
When "The Boys Of Summer" comes on
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rollin' through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
I Love that county line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she's been sipping that wine
I still get drunk on her every time
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through mind
Man, I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
I love that ragged old barn that my grandpa made
It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church, out on 109
It's where I hit my knees and thank the Lord for this life of mine
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life

Heaven
Mmm
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced

Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time


Telling on My Heart
Check out the moonlight filling up the night sky
Girl, how many times that you me sat right here
It always seems to get too late
Something tells me that I oughta wait
So while I got my courage up, and my mind still clear
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
Sayin' all kinds of crazy things
Like you're the only girl for me
Oh, baby, it was meant to be
And it just feels right
Yeah, how I think about you all the time
I can't seem to keep you off my mind
Kissing ain't the only thing I wanna do to you tonight
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
You know those secrets I've been keeping
Way down deep inside of me
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
'Cause I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I wanna tell you what I think
Underneath these stars
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart


Live Like You Were Dying
He said
"I was in my early forties
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the x-rays
And talkin' 'bout the options
And talkin' 'bout sweet time"
I asked him
"When it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit you
When you get that kind of news?
Man, what'd you do?"
And he said
"I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying"
He said
"I was finally the husband
That most of the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden going fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I, I finally read the Good Book, and I
Took a good, long, hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then
I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
Like tomorrow was a gift
And you've got eternity
To think about
What you'd do with it
What could you do with it
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?
Skydiving
I went Rocky mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
Man, I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying"
Woo


God's Country
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (yeah)
God's country
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country)
Yeah, I saw the light in the sunrise

Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine

Runnin’ Outta Moonlight
Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up, you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust that's my headlights, that's my truck
Come on baby, don't you keep me waitin'

Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms
Whoa, girl every now and then you get a night like this

Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
Girl I bet you thought I lost my mind
Outta the blue pulling into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear
Whoa, girl you never look better than you do right now
Whoa, oh heaven let your light shine down
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight

Beer in Mexico
Starin' out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and the lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should I try to grow up?
But who knows where to start
So I'll just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen 'em both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just tryin' to search my soul
For all the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go
So I'll just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Maybe I'll settle down, get married
Or stay single and stay free
Which road I'll travel is still a mystery to me
So I'll just sit right here, have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Down in Mexico


Burn Out
Watching cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts, how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
The smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done me wrong songs hit me so right
I'm so on fire for you it hurts, how
Fast as one cigarette can burn out
If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
It's a smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done me wrong songs hit me so right
I'm so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out

Secretary 
It's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
Girls, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
She takes the time to listen
To what he has to say
While all you do is nag him
A thousand times a day
Her hair is always pretty
And her clothes are always stylish
But you greet him with your hair in rollers
And that's outdated and so childish
Oh, it's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
We make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
Are you there when he needs you?
Are your favors less than cute?
And when he tries to love you
Do you find something else to do?
Now the ordinary girl may not wear pearls
Or diamonds on each hand
Oh, but like the secretary, wooh
She knows how to please her man
Oh, it's not extraordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
You see, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life, hey, hey
You see, life's a bowl of cherries
For all the secretaries, hey, hey
Oh, it's very ordinary, it's not extraordinary
Girls, don't be contrary or you'll make it necessary
Your life can be so merry just like the secretary
Life's a bowl of cherries

Knocked down and walked all over me
Now you've got yours, what about me?

Mama Feelgood 
I'm Mama Feelgood, I'm Mama Feelgood
Now I can make my lover reach for the stars when the sun is out, yeah
And I can make my man forget what he's thinkin' about, yeah
Now when my lover gotta have it, he don't need a thriller, no
But if he wants some lovin', I can be a painkiller, yeah
In other words what I'm tryin' to say is don't be a teaser, no
Be a love pleaser, be a love pleaser
Be a love pleaser, forget about the others and all the rest
Whatever you be, got to be the best
Now it's time for everybody to get ahold to yourself
You see life is too short and I'm afraid we just don't have enough time left
'Cause that's why they call me "Mama Feelgood," 'cause I do my thang
And I'm telling you it's about time you started doing it too
Now I can make my lover reach for the stars when the sun is out, yeah
Now men, let me hear you say somethin'
Guitar, let me hear you spank it
I can take a four dollar dress and let off a funky hymn
Now I can look plump and if he wants I can look slim
I'm Mama Feelgood, Mama Feelgood, I'm Mama Feelgood
I'm Mama Feelgood, Mama Feelgood, I'm Mama Feelgood
I'm Mama Feelgood, yeah, Mama Feelgood
I'm Mama Feelgood, hey!
I can pull off this suit, do anything you think I can't
And I can stand behind him and make him feel like a man, yes I can
He knows I can, and that makes him even more of a man
I'm Mama Feelgood

I won’t play your game (no more) 
I've been waiting all my life to get you boy
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Now I got you, you don't care for me
Now I got you, you don't care for me
Here I am, wasting time
I fool myself thinking I do it right
So, ok! It's enough
Don't wanna play your game no more
(I won't play your game no more)
I´m not gonna beg you to treat me carefully
'Cause it's too late to stay with me
I´m not gonna beg you to treat me tenderly
If you don't know what love is
Don't wanna wake up tomorrow morning and find out that there's nobody there
But don't wanna sleep with a man who is sharing a bed with somebody else
Oh! Here I am, wasting time
I fool myself thinking I do it right
So, ok! It's enough
Don't wanna play your game no more
You can call me night and day but, believe me, there will be no replay
When you need me, forget it
If you miss me, forget about it
If you wanna cry, ok! That's not my fault
It's your turn to feel like a fool
Remember that we played by your rules
Now the game is not so funny, right?
I got to say, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
(I won't play your game no more)

Take You Higher 
I feel like a million bucks, babe, and so should you
I know I could fill you up, babe, if you want me to
I'll give you my body, baby, not just my mind
Don't act like it's complicated, we'll be just fine
I can take you a little bit higher
I can be your one desire
Boy, I'm on to you
I can take you a litte bit higher
I can be your one desire
If you want me to
You think that you're out of luck, babe, you're feeling down (so down)
My shock will be enough babe to turn your fortunes around
(give you my body) Said I'll give you my body (ooh), baby, not just my mind (ooh)
Don't act like its complicated, we'll be just fine
I've been waiting, anticipating for so long
I've been trying to make you feel
Trying to make you feel, trying to make you feel this way

Yes We Can Can 
Now's the time for all good men
To get together with one another
We got to iron out our problems
And iron out our quarrels
And try to live as brothers
And try to find a piece of land
Without stepping on one another
And do respect the women of the world
Remember you all have mothers
We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give
I know we can make it
I know darn well we can work it out
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna get together we can work it out
And we gotta take care of all the children
The little children of the world
'Cause they're our strongest hope for the future
The little bitty boys and girls
We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give
I know we can make it
I know darn well we can work it out
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna, yes we can can

Am I The Same Girl 
Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Whom you hurt so
I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
The one you used to meet
Around the corner every day
We would meet and slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Whom you hurt so
I'm the one you hurt
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one who cried
I'm the one you used to meet
But you are pretending
You don't care
And the fire is still there
But we were no longer too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am

Baby, baby, tell me… Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?

But the way you treat me
It’s so hard to bear…
Baby, baby, tell me… Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
You trying to drive me completely away
Forgetting the love we shared just yesterday
But the way you’re acting now
Doesn’t seem to fit somehow
For all I see or seem
It’s just a dream within a dream
I see my baby and he is filled with joy
And he see’s that I’m not filled with his joy
All I hear is laughter, laughter from out there
Baby, baby, tell me… Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
See you baby and you’re filled with joy
And you see me baby I’m not filled with joy

With why and how I want to live
You're so rare, man, you're so fine
You know, I'm so glad you're mine
You're so very rare and so fine
I'm sure glad you're mine

When you work your way around
Ain't a part of me leftover
That your sweet love ain't found
You make my, my moan turn to whisper
You make my whisper turn to call
You make me scream and scream that I love you
When you, when you make me rise and fall
You're so rare, and you're so fine
And I'm so very, very, very glad you're mine
You're so rare and so fine
Oh, oh, you're mine, you're mine
You know, you know I want the best for you, baby
And what you want, I want for you
And we can, we can work together, baby
To see it, to see it all come true
'Cause you're so rare, and you're, you're so fine
And Lord knows, I'm so very glad you're mine
You're so rare, so rare, and you're so very, very fine
Oh, you cleared all the questions from my mind
We come a, we come a long, long way together, baby
Through the hard times and all the good
I'm gonna take this day to celebrate you, baby
'Cause I have to stop and praise you like I should
You're so rare, take yo' praise, and you're so fine
And I hope you know I'm glad you're mine
Take yo' praise, you're so rare, take yo' praise, you're so fine
Take yo' praise, I'm glad you're mine

Somebody’s Watching You 
Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture
Witty, witty, witty as you can be
Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free
Ever stop to think about a downfall?
Happens at the end of every line
Just when you think you've pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Games are to be played with toys, et cetera
Love is to be made when you'rе for real
Ups and downs are caused by lifе in general
Some are yours no matter how you feel
Shady as a lady in a moustache
Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon
The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you

Trouble with My Lover 
Sometimes I get lonesome
Sometime I get a little blue
He got me walking around in circles
And after that I don't know what to do
What good is a love
You can't have it when you want it
What good is a love
If you can't own it
Love can be so good
And love can be so cruel
Love can make you happy
Make you blow your cool
But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the little old dark
You know he fill me up with a kind of delight
Ooh, the man's all right
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble (trouble)
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble (trouble)
I feel so helpless
I can't help myself
I don't want to see him no no no no
With nobody else
In the restless hours
I sit home alone
I wished I believe oh yeah
This man I love
But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the little old dark
You know he fill me up with a kind of delight
Hey the man's all right

My Baby Just Cares for Me 
My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
Is somethin' he can't see
My baby don't care who knows
My baby just cares for me
Baby, my baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
He cares for me
My baby don't care
For cars and races
Baby don't care for
He don't care for high-tone places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Liberace's smile
Is something he can't see
Is something he can't see
I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for me

Killing Me Softly with His Song 
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
To listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
La la la, la la la
Ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh
La ahh ahhhhhh haaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ha ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh ahh
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me (softly)
He was strumming my pain
Yeah, he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me

Soul Man 
Comin' to you on a dusty road
Good lovin', I got a truckload
And when you get it, you got something
So don't worry, cause I'm coming
I'm a soul man

Uptight (Everything’s Alright)
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hanging on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can't buy
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, hahahahaha, yeah
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, way out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of...

Superfly 
Darkest of night with the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong; lotta things goin' on
The man of the hour has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Hard to understand what a hell of a man
This cat of the slum had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own but the man lived alone
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
The game he plays, he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' to get over
That's what he tryin' to do, y'all
Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Woo, Super Fly, huh, huh
The aim of his role was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream: what does it mean? He wouldn't know
"Can't be like the rest" is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out and there's no happiness
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Super Fly
Super Fly

Theme from Shaft 
Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
(Shaft)
Ya damn right
Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?
(Shaft)
Can you dig it?
Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?
(Shaft)
Right on
They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother...
(Shut your mouth)
I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft
(Then we can dig it)
He's a complicated man
But no one understands him but his woman
(John Shaft)

War 
(War, huh) Yeah!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, uhuh
(War, huh) Yeah!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Say it again, y'all!
(War, huh) Lookout!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me, awwwww!
War I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives
I said
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it again
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me!
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, awwww
War is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest, within the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
Awwww!
(War, huh) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) Oh-ohh yeah, huh
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), It's got one friend, that's the undertaker, awwww
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days
War can't give life, it can only take it away, awwww!
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Oh, absolutely nothing
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, woooo!
Peace, love and understanding
Tell me, is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows there's gotta be a better way, ooohhh
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) You tell me, say it, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Stand up and shout it (Nothing)

Ball of Confusion (That’s What the World Is Today) 
One, two
One, two, three, four, ow!
People movin' out, people movin' in
Why? Because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on
Well, the only person talkin' 'bout "Love thy brother"
Is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learnin'
But the teacher
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration Aggravation, humiliation, obligation to our nation
Ball of confusion
Oh, yeah
That's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey
The sale of pills are at an all-time high
Young folks walkin' 'round with their heads in the sky
Cities aflame in the summertime
And oh, the beat goes on
Evolution, revolution, gun control, the sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon, kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on
So 'round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, said, nobody knows
Oh, Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
Just a ball of confusion
Oh yeah, that's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey
Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand, population out of hand
Suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war"
And the band played on
Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
It's a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey
Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya
Sayin', ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey (Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya)

Ain't it funky
One, two, three, four
The name of this tune is 'The Funky Drummer'
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer

It’s Just Begun 
Watch me now
Feel the groove
Into something
Gonna make you move
Here we come
On the run
Don't know what
We're running from
Day or night
Black or white
Dance or sing
You gotta do your thing
You gotta do your thing
Peace will come
This world will rest
Once we have
Togetherness
Day or night
Dynomite
We had fun
But it's just begun
It's just begun
It's just begun
It's just begun (x 30)

You're the girl who makes me feel good
Cutie pie
You're the girl who makes me feel so good
Cutie pie
You're the girl who makes me feel good
Cutie pie

Lovely Day 
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you

And I know it's gonna be

And I know it's gonna be

Ms. Jackson 
Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times


99 Problems
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward"
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rear-view mirror is the motherfucking law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
"Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are"
I ain't stepping out of shit, all my paper's legit
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?"
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!"
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clapping
And he and his boys gonna be yapping to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratching again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snapping em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail 'cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassing them
Trying to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothing sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, being a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
You crazy for this one, Rick
It's your boy

Straight Outta Compton 
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
Yo, Ren! (What's up?)
Tell 'em where you from!
Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
Damn, that shit was dope!


Lose Yourself
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane

Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"

Rape and pillage your village, women and children

Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air

Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent

"She on a diet," but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me

Guard up high like I'm a master
But it's somethin' 'bout you
I can't see through
I got some funny feelings in my head and, girl, I don't know what to call it (Call)
Too iffy and quick, I can't say that it's love, but I know that I want some more of it (More)
These feelings been stuck in my head, ain't too big on love, but with you, I'm all for it (No)
See the world, me and you, we can tour it
Like, fuck all them bitches, ain't shit to ignore it (Oh)
Daily, you be on my mind, my heart hurt, beat, and bruised from the owner before it (Oh)
Got a good feeling this time, I been focused on you and I cannot ignore it (No)
Better than all of them combined
See, nothin' better than callin' you mine (Oh)
You a ten out of ten, you a dime
Fuck all the others, leave that shit behind
Sidestep, that's my flex
And you gon' die if you keep tryna play games
All I know is treacherous, fuck around, it's straight flames
Hate pain, but it's all through my veins
Rollin' dope, it go straight to my mind
How you be feelin', I'm one of a kind
Can't no one hold me back, how they gon' hold me back?
Destined to win, ain't no blockin' my shine
Took me a minute, I waited
Every year, shit get greater, I'm stuck in my prime
Soon get better, it's way more than fine
I be the type to just say less and grind
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like​
Na-na-na-na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you

And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn

MAFIA 
Custom the things, custom the wings
I had to custom the vibe, custom the link up
Cover the back of the lab, front cover magazine
Cover your eyes, cuddled up, back of the V (Yeah)
Our chemistry, just like the trappers and fiends (Ooh)
Our misery really ain't nothin' to see
I gotta travel the V, I like to travel to heat (Ooh)
Bring out a bag of the weed
Did I tell you I got my own weed? I had a lot to achieve
Blew it out and I'm relieved, take it down, now you relieve
Rather you leave, then you go back out on me
Don't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least
You know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week
Movin' at rapid speed, like it's a track, we meet
We got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah
Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust
Like it thick with a bounce, we all in the count
Wine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with the wave
Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house
You come with two when it's late, know the brown one is my fav'
Then Mike Brown gon' walk you out (Walk you out)
Step by step, watch yourself
Cleaners got anything you might've left
I couldn't do none of this by myself
With mafia, they in the tuck
I gave you fifty to boost up your butt
I gave you the juice, you'd rather get buzzed
I tried to choose you, you'd rather go club
Know what to do, you rattled me up
Common denominator, we were steps from the diamond ages
Got a couple of vibrations
For the simulation, gotta re-up the hydration
Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked (Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall through this town today)
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas around)
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust (We still pourin' up for the niggas that can't be around today)
Mm, mm, woah-ah, mm-mm
Woah, mm-mm, mm-mm
Fuck shit up at the club (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Drop down
Run around, run around
Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked (Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall through this town today)
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas around)
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust (We still pourin' up for the niggas that can't be around today)

JUST LIKE YOU 
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
It's strange the way the mind can wander, but also stop to gossip
And chat with memories that you and me aren't really fond of
Maybe you're out to find love, maybe you lost who you was
Maybе you're just like me and feel thе need to stay in your rut
'Cause if you left it, you might feel like you're no longer you
It's so impressive, the way the mind can play with the truth
It's interestin' that nobody can walk in your shoes
But still relate and feel the same, so in a way, guess we do
You ever think about what it would be like
If the clouds were gone and you could see light?
If the door was open, would you take flight
Or just close the curtains up and stay inside?
Take a walk with me, take a risk with me
I'm scared too and it gets so tempting
When you're so empty, to disown everything
You hold dearly when you know clearly
You been so buried in your own fairytale
The soul's tearin' bunch of holes in me
I relate to it, but in case you been
Thinkin' no one does, here's a great theory
Throw a Hail Mary, let ya mind fly
To the sun rise, could be so scary
Make your faith vary, feel the pain glaring
But the weight carried ain't in vain, hear me? (Hear me?)
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
So often I feel desperate, I think my heart's infected
How 'bout yours? How 'bout yours? How 'bout yours? I guess if
You feel the best when your life is hectic, you might be destined
To stay defective, so join the club, it ain't that hard to get in
It's hard to leave though, look at the guest list
I bet that your name is on it, don't believe me? Check it
See dead ends
In life we come to tend to raise some questions
Suggestion
Know that your feelings might give wrong directions (Infested)
Yeah, with the feeling of failure
Let it take over your body, it makes ya
Question the life that you have, situations
You might have enjoyed become nothin' but dated
Old and forgotten, but what would you say if
I told you that there was some hope we could make it?
I know what you're thinkin', I'm thinkin' it too
Could you really improve and be somethin' worth savin'?
See, I could pretend like I have all the answers
But none of us do, it's the reason we battle
Convincing yourself that you don't really matter's
Like feedin' a cancer and letting it travel
To every part of you, but what if we did
The unthinkable and cancel our trips?
What's achievable depends on the risk
So pick up your chin and listen to this
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you (You, you, you, you)
Yeah, everybody falls sometimes
Just remember that that's alright
It's the rainy days that give us love for the sun
And if it isn't, I guess I'll be fine believin' it does, oh yeah
Everybody falls sometimes
Just remember that that's alright
It's the lows in life that make you cherish the highs
And if it isn't, I guess I'll be fine believin' a lie (Ayy)
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you

STAR WALKIN’

Reachin' for a life that I don't really need at all
Never listened to replies, learned a lesson from the wise
You should never take advice from a nigga that ain't try
They said I wouldn't make it out alive

That's why I gotta kill 'em every time
Gotta watch 'em bleed, too
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'

Been that nigga since I came out my mama (Woo)
Thankin' God Daddy never wore a condom (Woo)
Prove 'em wrong every time 'til it's normal
Why worship legends when you know that you can join 'em?
Th-These niggas don't like me, they don't like me
Likely, they wanna fight me
Come on, try it out, try me
They put me down, but I never cried out, "Why me?"
Word from the wise, don't put worth inside a nigga that ain't try
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time
Gotta watch 'em bleed, too
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
'Nough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected
I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, Ps in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public
South London where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion

If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
And put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs

Yeah, yeah (Fly— Fly me to the moon)
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace

Body snatched, servin' face (In other words, hold my hand)

Frequent flyer, bad, she toned and tan
Free my gang, 013's and 020's (Darlin' miss me)
Oh God knows, I miss my bros

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

Judging from my vibe, you can feel it in my energy
Stacking paper steadily so I can live in luxury
Looking in the mirror, I thank God for what I'm about to be
You beefing with my enemy does not make you a friend of me
Girls so weird, stay clear, I'm living drama free

Obstacles be slowing me, but that buffer molded me
So I take my time, 'cause I'm always where I'm suppose to be

You can not get a hold of me? I'm probably in a solo meet
Always making moves, man that's how I keep my sanity

Double checking my expenses, never messy, always neat

Eating Fettucini pasta with the scallops and the lobsters

Anti-Hero
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman?
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving and life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it
And then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from hell!"
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me
Hi
Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees
It's me
Hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Time)
Everybody agrees
(Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I don't think he gon' make it
Do not let me start ragin'
Bitch, I'm losin' my patience
This ain't stayin' in Vegas (You ain't nothing but a)
There's more sides to the story, I'ma tell everybody
Had your ass sittin' courtside with your arm around me
Had your ass sittin' first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi
Could've been what we should've been but you lost a bet, now you gotta find me
Find a seat, nigga
I ain't playin' this hide and seek
High school when you finally peaked
Hound dog, come find a treat

Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
Yeah, yeah, I said (You ain't nothing but a)
I get it, I know you got some other shit you wanted
I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong
So I reckon, you leave all of your problems at the door to my city
You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks
When I release you in them sheets (You ain't nothing but a)
And keep my meaning discreet
Keep the clean in my Jeep
And put that Yeezy in your teeth
Let my demons off their leashes
If you even think to speak
I'ma give a whole new meaning
When you said you live in a dream
We can keep that shit asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your Gs
Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep
Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R-I-P

Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it

Bam Bam
You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now (Mmm)
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Yeah, that's just life, baby

Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam
It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now
I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'

Eh! 

Boyfriend
I can't believe we're finally alone
I can't believe I almost went home
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
And he's not with you (Hm, hm, hm, hm)
The universe must have divined this
What am I gonna do?
Not grab your wrist?
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend
I don't need to tell you twice
All the ways he can't suffice
If I could give you some advice
I would leave with me tonight
The universe must have divined this
Mm, mm, mm
Ladies first, baby, I insist
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could be a better boyfriend
I never would have left you alone
Here on your own
Glued to your phone
Never would have left you alone
For someone else to take you home
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus you know my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit

Not Another Rockstar
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Pinky promised I was quittin'
Pinky promised that I wouldn't love somebody if they didn't
I'm a girl with big ambitions, but did I listen?
No, no, no, no
They're tortured and I wouldn't understand it
Plus they got a lot of unexamined father/son baggage
They don't wanna talk about it, is that a challenge?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsessive and I sign up, sign up
Ooh
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
He's been a player since the cradle
Aren't I lucky 'cause he could have chosen any girl to fuck with?
And he chose me, so I guess I should be grateful
No, no, no, no
Hmm, funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsessive and I sign up, sign up
Where's the pen? Where's the line?
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Ooh, not another rockstar
Ooh, not another rockstar
Glad that I got out before it got dark
You could be a better person, no, it's not hard
If there was a moment in this where you saw it goin' different, tell me what part
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar" 

Nonsense
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to don't leave me alone
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen now you got me feelin' thrown
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like bleh, blah, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song I wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill I must have lost it
I don't even know I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking, all around clock
I'm talking hope nobody knocks
I'm talking opposite of soft
I'm talking wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like blah, blah, bleh, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill I musta lost it
I don't even know I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking
I'm talking
I'm talking
This song catchier than chicken poxes
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning thought I'd write a pop hit
How quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz?

uh oh
Feel your eyes watchin' me
So I'm movin' on him just so you can see
Told you I was gonna get you right back
Oh, you don't really like that? (Oh)
I'm yours again (Oh) when you walk away (Oh)
You know if you leave, I ain't gonna stay (Oh-oh-oh)
When I'm doin' good, you get me off track (Oh)
And I guess I kinda like that (Oh)
You make me really, really good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missin'
Seven texts and two missed calls
Know I can't ignore 'em all
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied
Uh, uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb
Uh-oh, now we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
Roll your eyes, like you do
Should have known it's always the same with you
Tryin' not to feel our connection
But, oh my god, it's kinda temptin'
You said, "Can we leave now?" (Oh)
I don't think we should (Oh)
Through the back door (Oh)
That won't end good (Oh)
How 'bout my place?
Shit, you know I would (Oh)
Then I follow you out
Hope nobody looks
You make me really, really good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missin'
Seven texts and two missed calls
Make you wait before I fall
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied
Uh, uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb
Uh-oh, now we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
(Again, again)
Again, again
(Again, again)
Again, again 

W.I.T.C.H.
Rumor on the street is that her apples are delicious
The jury said she's charming but her exes say she's wicked
I swear to god I saw her howling at the sky
She ain't out to get you but she's better on your side
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself
Villainous kitty queen, she's got tricks up her sleeve
And I got a few up mine
She said, am I bad to the bone cause I get what I want
Mama said it ain't no crime
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Come out and play, it's fun in the dark
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge
Baby don't run, you're breaking my heart
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, what a woman, woman, yeah
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself 

TV
I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade
Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
And I don't get along with anyone
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem

How Could You
You said you were sober
So I let you come over
Your words pulled me closer
But your words fuck me over
I kept on denyin'
So you kept on tryin'
You went too far for closure
Too far fucked me over
I could just lie here, say, "It's okay"
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
Set it on fire and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you? How could you?
Oh, I more than regret you
You've convinced yourself I let you
The better version of me never met you
Never let you in my bedroom
Oh, all those shitty lines and crooked blinds
And cheap red wine stains
Threaten suicide to change my mind
And keep me afraid
You want me to lie here, and say, "It's okay"
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
Set it on fire and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you? How could you?
I once loved a liar
'Cause he knew my name
Would rewrite the story
And make me to blame
How could you?

October Passed Me By
I keep the letters that you wrote
In a secret place
Every now and then I go
Down memory lane
October passed me by
Just like any month
But I still think of the times
You took the breath out of my lungs
You don't have to run
Yeah, I got bitter when you got cold
Could you really blame me though
'Cause I'm still tied up when you go
You know this song is about you
Who else could it be?
You were the first to make me
Feel like I was me
Just a memory
It wasn't all good, yeah
It wasn't all pretty
Lost our grip
While tryna go steady
Holding on to you like maybe
One day we'll meet
I met you at the wrong time
Didn't wanna see
I was busy with the stars
You were looking at me
For better or for worse
I don't know
But for what it's worth
I made you my whole world
I made you my whole world
Screaming at the top of my lungs, "I love you my girl"
Always in the back of my mind
You'll be my girl 

Norman Fucking Rockwell
Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said, "I love you"
You're fun and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood
Ah-ah
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you?
You-oh-oh
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue
You make me blue
Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue 

Dance Monkey
They say, "Oh my God, I see the way you shine
Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine"
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time

You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Stray
I wanna write a song
One that can explain my loss
I wanna write a song
That you can hear and
Know how my heart yearns
And how my insides churn
And how my cheeks burn
From the weekly storm
And how my face turns
Before you return to the wall
And then down the floor
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I will stray
I gotta write a song
But I wanna feel my words
And I keep getting it all wrong
Think it out, write it out, rip it out
Throw it all to the wall
And I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
But I keep only seeing rain
I'll keep saying no
But you'll find your way into my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I'll stray
Wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna feel the way I used to

Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot
Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Oh, yeah, yeah
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah 

The First One
I know I shouldn't say what I'm 'bout to say
'Cause it's never okay to go and bring your exes up
No matter what
My second and my third, I hate they got the worst of me
They don't deserve the way that I was treating them
I'd lead them on
When I knew what I was doing
I was stupid, I was ruined, I was healing
But the healing never happened
And I'm sorry that I did you wrong
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah
I just can't forget some of the words he said
The memories in my bed keep coming back again
Like daggers in my mind, yeah
They draw blood all night, yeah
Yeah, I know what I've been doing
Running through 'em just to try and catch a feeling
But the feeling never happened
And I'm sorry that I did you wrong
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
No, there ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
Promise that it kills
Every time you send
A picture from a place
You and I used to go
I hope you know
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
No, there ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
No, there ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
(No, there ain't nothing I can do about it) Yeah, yeah 


Runaway
I was listening to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands, down
I had a dream I was seven
Climbing my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waiting, impatient, for me, down
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you
And for a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, down
And all this time I have been lying
Oh, lying in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
La di da!
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
But I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
I can't take it anymore 

Bad Guy
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along
With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad
Bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean
I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy

If I Can't Have You
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room (Yeah)
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know, that you're the feeling I'm missing

Maniac
You were with your friends, partyin'

Said you wanted me dead so
You show up at my home all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause
People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated

Old Me
Shout out to the old me
And everything he showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
Never a night alone
Anywhere you wanna go
Woke up in the morning
Wearing someone else's clothes
Pictures in my phone
With people I don't know
Woke up in the morning
How the hell'd I make it home?
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
But I wondered if I ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done
I would do it over now
I'd do it over
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me
Another round, here we go
Going in, blow for blow
Look into the mirror, take the punches that I throw
I'm constantly reminded
Of all the compromises
By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
But I wondered if I ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never shoulda done
I would do it over now
I'd do it over
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me
Devil at my door
Got me knocking, knocking, knocking
On the other side
Ashes on the floor
But I'm walking, walking, walking
Out of here alive
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me, ay, ay 

Young Dumb & Broke

Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us

I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

Celestial
You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again
I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're going down
And I know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial
You see the light shinin' through the rain
A thousand colors in the brighter shade
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's a silver lining that surrounds the gray
When I get lost will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're going down
Know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial, ohh
We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things
When we notice that's what really matters is
Make tonight go on and on and on
You make me feel
(We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things)
You make me feel
(When we notice that's what really matters is)
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space

Forget Me
Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow, it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me dead
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe
Oh, I
Even after all, it still wrecks me
To find out you knew how to forget me
Even after all this time
Days ache and nights are grey
My heart is still your place, babe
Guess I still feel the same
Know you can't stand my face
Some scars you can't erase, babe
Guess you still feel the same
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe
Oh, I
Even after all, it still wrecks me
To find out you knew how to forget me
Even after all this time
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh (Even after all this time)
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe
Oh, I

Loser
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I just might get a little too drunk so I won't think about us
I don't think about what we could have been
And I stay up like three or four nights so I won't dream about us
Wake up with no luck
I just can't win
I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
It hurts whenever someone says her name (Someone says her name)
When we were going off and on (Ah)
I guess I really played it wrong (Ah)
I should have never let her slip away
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind

I just might been a little too gone when she needed somebody
Up against her body (Ooh) at 2 am
Yeah, and now I keep lying to myself when she's just joking probably
(She's joking probably)
She'll probably call me and we'll be us again
I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
Now she's in love and I'm in second place (Damn)
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her? (Lose her)

Or am I living for nothing?
Don't know where it went wrong but I'll just take the hint
It's gonna take some adjusting
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her? (I'll never)

How Do I Say Goodbye
Early morning
There's a message on my phone
It's my mother saying, "Darling, please come home"
I fear the worst
But how could you leave us all behind?
There's so much to say but there's so little time
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
When I couldn't, you always saw the best in me
Right or wrong, you were always on my side
But I'm scared of what life without you's like
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes
And I promise if you go, I will make sure she's alright
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
And there's no way you could ever let me down
Gonna steal some time and start again
You'll always be my closest friend
And someday we are gonna make it out
Just hold the light, just hold the light
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

The Best Is Yet To Come
There's nothing you could tell me
That would make me walk away
'Cause in my eyes you're perfect
And there's nothing I would change
I've seen you on your best days
And I'll see you on your worst, my love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know the last few years
Have been a test of character
Remind ourselves on darker days
The best is yet to come
In life, I've made a few mistakes
But you were never one, my love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be here if you need love, if you need strength
Forever by your side until the end
With me, you really don't have to pretend
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love

One Life
It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I gotta do
To be making a change now, the moment of truth
Why am I feeling so nervous when
Things are going so perfect ten?
But I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to her lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holding me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
The sun will reappear, burning auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass knoll was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way of falling deeper in you
Why was I feeling nervous when
Things were going so perfect ten?
And now I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be

What you, ooh, uh, what'd you do?
Made a move, could've made a move
If I knew I'd be with you
Is it too late to pursue?
I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear

Uh, can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?
Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
Now you're not too good for me, my dear
Funny you come back to me, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (Wish I knew), I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)
You can't surprise a Gemini (I wish I knew)
I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed (I wish I knew you wanted me)
Now that you're back, I can't decide (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied and
I turn it on and make it rowdy
Then carry on, but I'm not hidin'
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found

But you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
I knew you'd come back around
'Cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
Let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
Go stupid, go crazy, babe
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end
You'll miss me, don't beg me, babe

Glimpse Of Us
She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she is so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working
So what can I do?
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
And find me again
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us

Small Reminders
Time is racing (yeah, yeah)
Life seems so long (so long, hey, uh)
Don't go wasting
Before it's all gone
Never stop, never quit, never that (never that)
Promises that I make to myself (yeah)
Big drip so I stay in my bag (big drip)
Bad bitch, make a hater so mad (woo)
Lookin' up, there's snakes in the grass
Don't mix, so I stay on my own
When I get to the top it's a wrap
Ain't nobody tellin' me shit about shit
And that's that
Now or never
Perfect timing
I'll live forever
The stars keep shining
Love will find us
Don't go chasing
Small reminders
Time is racing
I spend fifty-five on the fill-up
Fill-up
I got the top down in the winter
Winter, it's windy
I keep the cookies and the doobie lit up
Lit up, uh
I'm dodgin' police, gotta duck tonight
Tonight
And I'm hella fly, push it up, feelin' soft
Wonderful, rolling up the weed and
I live it up, goin' through the ceilin' now
Came back, do a three-peat, Michael Jordan
Uh, I got the dream and I see it clearer
Before my head ever hit the pillow
I paid my dues and I feel like enough is enough
And enough is enough, and enough is enough, and enough is enough
Goin' so dumb
Goin' crazy
Losing count of
Blunts, still fancy
They say nothing lasts forever
Be in pain or be in pleasure
Nothing hurts me anymore unless I let it
We're the lucky ones
What do you dream about
When no one else is there to listen?
What do you wish for?
What do you care about?
Got so much weight all on your shoulders
You secretly carry around
You look in the mirror
When you think about your mistakes
Don't make a sound
Who are you really though?
When no one can convince you different
Do you even know?
If you could undo what you're going through
Would you?
Ooh, you and me


Shooter Interlude
And I'm keeping all this part too
Can I borrow some money?
Can you call me an Uber?
My mama needs surgery
And my son needs a scooter
Can you start up my start-up?
Can you move my maneuver?
I think you need Jesus
I think you need a shooter
So who you been fuckin'? Who you been foolin'?
How many bottles you got in your mini cooler?
S on your chest, but you never feel super
Do you ever feel stupid? Do you call out for Cupid?
Can I borrow your chains? Can I have your last name?
Can I come over later? And can I overstay my welcome?
Downplay the help, but don't say I ever
Borrowed your paper, don't forget the favors I did for you
Before you blew up
Knew you before you grew up
I used to babysit you, dated your baby sister
I wanted babies with you
Your daughter's supposed to be mine
Shouldn't have wasted your time
Put a ring on your finger
'Cause you've been dating lames
And all those famous names
Playin' those famous games
So can I borrow some money?
Call me an Uber
My mama needs surgery
And my son needs a scooter
Start up my start-up
Move my maneuver
I think you need Jesus
Think you need a shooter
Think you need a
Think you need a shooter
I think you need Jesus, huh
Think you need a shooter

You should know by now how I feel
That my love is real
Feels secure knowing

Ya so moist
Plus you got the platinum voice
And you fine smelling like 360 Divine
You blow my mind away
Tonight and forever like diamonds al right
We tight like that
Stress time for chillin'
Times is short good and part
Cause you know you're my dime
The top illin'
They jealous cause me you styles killin'
ain't nothin' happenin' with that breakdown talk
We can walk the walk and keep it real
Like New York I'm sold up, you word up uh
If we just show'em I'll blow'em twice
And we'll just keep flowin' like Chardone'
On ice as we lounge in the crib and parle'
You know what I mean
Not to mention your lover supreme
Move's truly with throughout the evening
I'm here no question as long as I'm peepin' Illtown
Repeat Chorus Until Fade......

So where's my millionaire

I just wanna lay back, spend my baby money in his Maybach
I deserve that life
Be a damn good housewife
Two kids from a surrogate
Fly mama, I'ma stay fit, gettin' facelifts
Soccer mom, gettin' wasted (Wasted)
Hermès tennis bracelet (Bracelet)
Bora Bora for vacation
I'll be anything but basic
On the other side

My Mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
Pretendin' I have the patience
Pretendin' there is enough time for waitin'
Rememberin' when we kept it all basic
I wanna go back so that I could taste it
What do I care for?
You were not there anymore
I was not careful
That is all your fault
You let me fall
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
Buried alive here inside a nightmare
Livin' a life where you're gone
There is no light here
It'll be light-years until my mind's clear (you're gone)
I did it all for love
I did it all
I'd trade it all for you
I'd trade it all
But what do I care for?
What are you here for?
If you're not there when I call?
I was not careful
And that's all your fault
You let me fall
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (in my mine)
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
This ain't how it's supposed to be
You and me supposed to be
Remember when it be just you and me
In your crib smokin' trees
Like you took control of me
You had a hold of me
Had me so gone, baby
Yeah, you had me givin' me all of me
Now it's all over, it's all done
Shouldn't have never told ya, you're the one
I'll be all right
I will be just fine
I'll be okay
Once you get out my mind
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (in my mine)
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
In my mine
In my mine, mine
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sunset Eyes
Feels like our love's in eclipse
It's like it has a different you to it
The room, the mood
The moonlight was dim
I know you felt that, right?
That night, I couldn't describe
The feeling when I saw the sunset in your eyes
'Cause I, I knew something wasn't right
The sight of us was fallin'
That night, I couldn't describe
The moment when I realized that it was time for us
To say that somethin' isn't right
The thought of us has faded away
Feels like we're forcing this
Even your touch has different weight to it
You kiss my lips and I'm indifferent
I didn't feel that high
That night (that night), I couldn't describe
The feeling when I saw the sunset in your eyes
'Cause I, I knew that something wasn't right
The sight of us was fallin'
That night, I couldn't describe
The moment when I realized that it was time for us
To say that somethin' isn't right
The thought of us has faded away

One
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No need, it's too late (would I have to suffer?)
Goddamn, this pressure is having me feeling frustrated
And all this bad weather followin' me like we datin'
Tryna be what they dream, what they fantasize
And still be me, me, myself at the same fuckin' time
And man, it's never been like this, I'm feelin' so faded
And not in the good way that you get from drinkin' Jamie
Tryna see where life leads, what the future lies
Anxiety all on me, keepin' me up at night
It's already rough dealin' with this stuff
Don't know if I'll move up, am I good enough?
One step at a time (hello), yeah (hello)
I've got to lighten up, stop being so tough
But when I make it up the way I dreamed of
Will I ever find it? (Hello, hey), yeah, yeah, yeah
And I don't know if I'll ever succeed
I just want you proud of me up above
(What you seek, you will find when you look inside)
(All these things on your mind, just a waste of time)
One thing I promise, I'll make you happy
Don't forget that I will never give up
Shit, it's been a week, only felt like a one day
Tryin' to get some sleep, time itself keeps on warpin'
You and me just ain't working right
Just like that, what a thing is to realize
Never call 'em back, pretty whack, that's my forté
Tryna get the stack, platinum racks, but the right way
All my love workin' overtime
And for what? Just to feel like I done missed my prime
It's already rough dealin' with this stuff
Don't know if I'll move up, am I good enough?
One step at a time, yeah (one step at a time, whoa)
I've got to lighten up, stop being so tough
But will I make it up the way I dreamed of?
Will I ever find it? (Will I ever find it?)
And I don't know if I'll ever succeed
I just want you proud of me up above (up above)
(What you seek, you will find when you look inside)

One thing I promise, I'll make you happy
Don't forget that I will never give up (eh), I, I
And I don't know if I'll ever succeed (I don't know)
I just want you proud of me up above (up above, I don't know)
One thing I promise, I'll make you happy (thing I promise)
Don't forget that I will never give up
I tried to
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No need, it's too late

Cranes in the Sky
I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair
I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder
I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away, away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Well, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
I tried to run it away
Thought then my head be feeling clearer
I traveled 70 states
Thought moving 'round make me feel better
I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away (don't you cry, baby)
Away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
But it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds

Why Don't We Fall in Love
So many things I'm goin' through
So much that I wanna do
It startin' to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really what it seems
So many days I've thought of you

Why don't we (so why don't we), don't we
Why don't we, why don't we (yeah)
Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (why don't we fall in love)
(It's so many reason)
(It's the only thing that matters to me)
Why don't we fall in love
It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one I never want to go
Think I never did know what to do
A love I never felt, now I feel with you
Why don't I just swallow each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend
Why don't we, don't we (why can't we)
Why don't we (why can't we), why don't we (why can't we)
Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (we, can't we fall)

Be Your Girl
Don't know if you got a girl
Don't mean to disrespect but
Thoughts of you rule my world
I even dream of you, I swear
Visions of you and I
See you all around my way
Been meaning to say hi but
I'm just way too shy
I gotta make you see this is
More than just a silly crush
wonder if you even notice me and
(Oh) you gotta feel me
(And I) would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)
All alone at night
I harbor feelings for you
Holding my pillow tight
Sometimes I even touch myself
Imagining your pleasure, baby
Next time I see you I'm
Gonna walk right up to you and
Say what's on my mind
I gotta make you see, this is
(More) than just a silly crush

Gonna Love Me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
We do things in between the lines
We should do more to stand out
I'm sorry if I made you feel less than who you are
A little insecure, oh, you's a shinin' star
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that you're all alone
Thinkin' 'bout what you're gon' do
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
Sometimes I don't think we really say enough
Why is it so hard to keep in touch?
When we're layin' right next to each other, baby
We shouldn't read into things so much
Overthinkin', understandin'
Don't let a feelin' change it up
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that I'm all alone
Thinkin' 'bout what I'm gon' do

A Long Walk
You're here, I'm pleased
I really dig your company
Your style, your smile, your peace mentality
Lord, have mercy on me
I was blind, now I can see
What a king's supposed to be
Baby I feel free, come on and go with me
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18
Your background it ain't squeaky clean (shit)
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all are sinners
But you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner
I respect that, man you're so phat
And you're all that, plus supreme
Then you're humble man I'm numb
Yo with feeling, I can feel everything that you bring
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Revelation 3:17
Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday (Saturday)
Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze and listen to a symphony
Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent
Come on, Come on
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe baby, maybe we can save the nation
Come on, Come on

Emotional Rollercoaster
Last night I cried, tossed and turned
Woke up with dry eyes
My mind was racing, feet were pacing
Lord, help me, please tell me what I have gotten into
Ran my three miles to clear my mind
It always helps me out, it's my therapy
When I'm losing it which is usually
I'm on an emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
But I can't get off
This emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
Oh, I can't get off
Yesterday, I told myself I was gonna be okay
Gonna start a new day, be truly happy
I was gonna take control of me
But eventually reality hit me mentally, physically, emotionally
And I opened my eyes and realized
That I was still being taken for a constant ride on your
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
I can't get off
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
I can't get off
So tired of you making love to me
Then disappearing so suddenly
Up and down it goes
And I'm so tired of you pacifying me
With promises you know that you'll never keep
Round and round it goes
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off

Toni Braxton, oh
Ha ha, uh huh
Yeah, uh uh
Darkchild, yeah
… Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first?
… What you thinkin'?
Stop blamin' me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's the chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah?
Not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you
… What are you thinking?
Did you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
… Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then, why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't find
All the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out
… What you thinkin'?
Stop blamin' me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know, now here's the chance

So many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change
Girl, you better recognize the game, oh yeah

And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away

Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archer's bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Keep em high y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me
Beautiful

Burn
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn

Static
Baby, you got somethin' in your nose
Sniffin' that K, did you feel the hole?
Hope you find peace for yourself
New boyfriend ain't gon' fill the void
Do you even really like this track?
Take away the drugs, would you feel the noise?
More and more you try to run away
You fucking yourself, do you feel the toy?
Uh, lookin' for a bitch 'cause I'm over boys
Would you be my girlfriend, baby?
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Somethin' turned me off
Smoking made me

For somethin' secure
If you had to (if you) stunt your shining (oh, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)
For your lover, dump that fucker
Shoo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Soul Sista
La da, da, da
Hey sister
It's all in her eyes, you and me
Words just disguise all the things that you need
What is deep, it's deeper than skin
So Lord only knows
This kind of vibe gets stronger in time
Won't go on unnoticed
So concrete can't hold it
Hearts filled righteously
Whatever it is, I know that it's real
As long as you know
No complaints, you're all that I feel

Charlene
Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
To hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold
She must have told me a thousand times before
Silent cries I use to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things
But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
Promise I can't live without her
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone
I pray that she'll come back one day
In my life
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
Oh oh oh
Sometimes I cry
Charlene if you're listening would you call on me
Because my heart is aching

Find a Way
It used to be, we would be the best of all friends
It turned to be L O V E and I was your man
So you was my lady-friend, we spent time
I found a way to be by your side
Through the ins and outs, the wrongs and rights
After a while of bein' settled down, I didn't know how to keep the love
'cause I was young, I wish I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't let you go, I swear I would've made this love grow
I spent a lot of time and a lot of dough
Tryin' to match what we had and now I, I
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
Wish that I would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know until you left, I loved your smile
Just the other day your girl said that you can't stand me
I know you don't mean that
Can't we just slow down a minute and talk it out?
I've been through my share of love since then
Don't know about what you've been through
But nothin' compares to what we had
All I know is I need you back and I know that you need me back
Baby, let's try again to find our love
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
I can't forget the times we shared
Didn't know love until love was gone
'Til I moved on
Now I'm right back to square one again
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
Find our love, baby
Find our love, baby

Everybody got somethin' to say

CYANIDE
I love dominantly
You make me weak, make me thirsty for release
Gwan come compliment me
Dem become an enemy
Cop a flight to Paris, lowkey
'Cause lil' baby girl I'm tryna breathe
Please baby try to understand me
I am not a monster, I'm just a man with needs
I take flights, when I learn it's time to go
Tryna take time by crossing timing zones
Come press your lips 'pon me
LSD got me feelin' empathy
Warfare out to mind chemically
'Cause we suffer endlessly
Could be Kamikaze, only time will tell
Even though I'm godly, might end up in Hell
Sweet melody, wind up your body 'pon mi
Your lovin' baby girl, you know mi need it, need it
Let me fight for it, me achieve it, 'chieve it
Sweet melody, wind up your body 'pon mi

Forevermore you gon' be my kin
Whatever jaw has binded, let no man enter in
Give me your love, it's unrequited
The thought of you gets me excited
I guess I'll come to your crib, uninvited
Offer you all your favorite vices, girl I know you like it
Girl you can't do like, like me

Still
It's been a long time since we last spoke
I still wonder what you're up to
After all the shit we've been through
And I've been spending a lot of time drinking and smoking
Hoping to subdue
The thought of you in my head
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questioning what is he doing
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
It still hurts
There's been a lot of nights when I feel alone
Needed someone to talk to
'Cause I just need to get through
And I've been spending a lot of money
On things that I don't need
Hoping that I'll feel new
But I can't get you out my head
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questioning what is he doing
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain (girl, I've been trying to find a way)
Since you've been away (a way that I can numb this pain)
I don't wanna feel anymore (I don't wanna feel)
And there's probably people telling you
That I'm doing fine (I'm just tryna get you outta my head)
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
It still hurts

Killing Me
You
You
Why, do I depend on you?
6 then I'm 'bout to pull up
Think 'bout your body too much
I'm feeling you for real
Missin' the party for what?
There ain't nobody but us
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through (uh)
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right you're killing me
That's right you're killing me
Adrenaline gentlemen, baby
Skeletons that I don't hold back
Try to stop, do you feel relaxed?
Love it when you make me feel like that
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through (uh)
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, you're killing me
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, you're killing me
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, that's right, that's right

That's right, that's right, that's right (ooh, ooh-woah)
That's right, that's right, that's right

Been tryna give it some time
Feelin' like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than try to understand
Mornin' sun, mornin' high
Oh, I think this haze is for now my best disguise
No need to think about why

Whether there's a reason or not
Don't try givin' me reasons to stop

Easily
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
We had a good thing going lately
Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know
That they ain't real
I'll take the truth over the story
You might've tried my patience lately
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do something for me?
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Coming and going
Inside out
Back to front
All tangled and messy
That's how we've been and we'll always be
And that's alright with me
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

Never smile in my photos
Penthouse view downtown
Owed up, what that bank look like?
Extended all my credit lines
Hear a lot of noise coming out your mouth
I get wilted roses from the crowd
Bet you bought a ticket just so you could say you
Saw it when the shit went down
Where that nigga at now?
Now you got your wishes, had to sell the whiz kid
People say I'm falling
Used to be the man, now the man's down (man's down)
How did I get so caught up?
Why even try? Try to defy?
I'm the type to press my luck
Why fall in line? I don't care no more, no more
Feel a little woozy, can't stand now (oh)
Everybody's smiling, got their hands outside
Don't know how to keep dry
Hear a lot of noise coming out your mouth
(Coming out your mouth, baby)
They throw wilted roses from the crowd
And I'm sure you bought yourself a ticket just so you could say you
Saw it when the shit went down
Where that nigga at now?
Well you got your wishes, I lost my position
People say I'm falling (people say I'm falling)

Miss Summer
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time, living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Every night, I recall this same love (on and on again)
Although my dreams are all she's made of (on and on again)
Like a truce to be made
There's two sides to the pain
Pray I choose right anyway
Wired to chasе love
Wipe my tears in thе face of death
No need for a chaser
Hoping the moment don't fade 'til I'm high again
Focus on mine, keep faith, and we'll fly again
Love, at least I can when you're right here
I know the feeling might change when the night ends
Unless the world stops for you, but
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on again

Kids in the Dark

The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa (The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
Whoa, whoa
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

Shots
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space?
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here
But I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishin' I had
What I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole (Oh, let me make it up to you)
Through every single thing that I loved
(Let me make it up to you)
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away (Let me make it up to you)
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Supermodel
Alone at parties in a deadly silhouette
She loves the cocaine, but cocaine don't love her back
When she's upset, she talks to Maury and takes deep breaths
She's a '90s supermodel, uh-uh-uh
Way back in high school, when she was a good Christian
I used to know her, but she's got a new best friend
A drag queen named The Virgin Mary takes confessions
She's a '90s supermodel
Yeah, she's a master, my compliments
If you wanna love her, just deal with that
She'll never love you more than money and cigarettes
Every night's a heartbreak
Hey, don't think about it, hey, just let it go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll (Hey)
Savor every moment 'til she has to go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll
Alone at parties, she's working around the clock
When you're not looking, she's stealing your Basquiat
Low-waisted pants on OnlyFans, I'll pay for that
She's a '90s supermodel
Yeah, she's a master, my compliments
If you wanna love her, just deal with that
She'll never love you, you just look a bit like her dad
Every night's a heartbreak
Hey, don't think about it, hey, just let it go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll (Hey)
Savor every moment 'til she has to go

Strangers
Maybe I'll just be fucked up forever
Should have figured myself out by now
And I don't wanna tear myself open, no
But it's hard to care when you bleed out
So won't you break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room full of strangers
Well I guess my guardian angel missed the memo
'Cause we're walking on razors again
And we swore to God we'd never let this happen, no
We've dragged ourselves through hell and we'll be damned if we go back
Break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess that I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, it don't
Where did we go?
We're all alone, all alone
No place like home
Take us back to yesterday
S.O.S
Save us from ourselves
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room, we're just a room
We're just a room full of strangers

All the Things I Hate About You 
Haha
Take a bow
You've got everybody fooled, I got you figured out
Now you’re choking on your words, well, you should spit it out
Know that I gave you the world and you just gave me hell
And you gave me hell
Felt like a hundred punches
Too many tough pills to stomach
I watched you making it public
Lights, camera, fuck it
You're a showstopper
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about you
(All the things I hate about you)
You could’ve had a rockstar
But you chose up on a bum-star
Bootleg version of me, that's your loss
Had to find out through a photo
Hangin' on your arm like a knockoff
Stab me in the back like nothing
Never even saw this comin'
I watched you making it public
Lights, camera, fuck it
You're a showstopper
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about you
You won't break me again and say it's all in my head
Holdin’ his hand in that dress from the night that you left
I’m so sick of the pain, I'll never see you the same
Guess that’s the price that you pay for the mess that you made
You're a showstopper (Let's go)
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common (Okay)
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you (Yeah)
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me (Yeah)
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about—
Every single thing about you

Pass The Nirvana 
Yeah
Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear
Suicide season is upon and high
Why you always saying, "Let the good times roll"?
Kick your mind open like a punk rock show
Uppercut, bleeding through a softened nose
If you didn't come home injured, would you say it was a good show?
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tеnsion
Through the tension, right now
This is only a distraction
Swing, batter up, lеt's play
Power until the target bleeds
This gun would never turn on me
So, Paul Meany, will you drop that beat
Why you always saying, "Let that shit go"?
Pennywise fashion on a sad skid row
A gentrified neighborhood of blood-soaked homes
Draw the lines a little further, now they're coming back to get you
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
Yo, I can't shine to save my life
But I'll feel through the dark without you
I set fires ablaze inside
And stepped into the light to blind you
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
I can't hear you

​Maybe 
That's hard
Two, three, five
Maybe if I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There's shadows on the wall, wish I would've ran (Yeah)
Gotta get away, I hope you understand
I try to hide my face like a wanted man (Yeah)
Maybe I'll be gone before you count to ten
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking thе last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm rеady to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last
Maybe if we went another way (Another way)
I wouldn't be regretting the decisions that I made
I don't want to spend another day (Another day)
Looking for somebody that I know I can't replace
My tears fall, you don't miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history
I think I'm broke and nothing can fix me
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last
Yeah (Maybe)
We were built to fall apart
But I can't feel you now
And it's too late now, there's no point screaming
Dug your grave, so fuck your feelings
No one's here, so now you're on your own
Made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last

Black Summer 
A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon
(Hit me now)
Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew (Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton, the archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun
It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on anothеr black summer to end
It's been a long time and you nеver know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
Crack the flaming whip, a-sailin' on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end

San Quentin 
Let's get this circus on down the road
We're takin' bets how far a tank of gas will go
Call up your best friend, then call two more
About to do some shit that you ain't seen before
There ain't no backdoor, there ain't no sign
Location changes almost every other night
Last time we found it, can't remember much
I thought I was a God until my lawyer woke me up and said I
Testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Got out on bail, we hit the town
Somebody told me we should burn it to the ground
Too many favors, too much to drink
Come 6 AM, they had me back inside the clink
I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Tough to find, a goddamn alibi
Wrong or right, it's tough to justify
Can't dismiss, too many witnesses
When insanity's the pattern, it don't matter what it is
I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?

Face It Alone 
When something so near and dear to life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul is set on fire
When something so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside
Your cries can be heard
So loud and clear
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it all alone
When something so dear to your life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul is burned alive (Burned alive)
When somethin’ so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside
Your cries can be heard
So loud and clear
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it alone
When the moon has lost its glow
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da, da, da, da-doh
When the moon has
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da, da, da, da-doh
When the moon
When the moon has lost its glow
You have to face it all alone

Sweet Child O’ Mine 
She's got a smile that it seems, to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry
Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
Woah-oh-woah
Sweet child of mine
Ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sweet love of mine
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Mm-mm, oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Sweet child)
Mm-huh, where do we go now?
Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-oh (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Ooh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-oh, wow
Where do we go?
Oh-oh, where do we go now?
(Oh) Where do we go, oh-oh-oh-oh? (Oh, wow)
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Woah-oh, where do we go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Sweet child
Sweet child of mine

It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, (kiss away, kiss away)

Back in Black 
Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die

Nobody's gonna get me on another rap

Creep
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep

What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

Detroit Rock City 
...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...
"..Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day..."
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio, it goes
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why?
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Get up


Livin’ on a Prayer 
Once upon a time, not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer
Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Wish You Were Here 
And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes, now which is it?
I am sure of it
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

Everlong 
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head, she sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when

Something in the Way
Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped, have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass, and the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm

Basket Case 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?
And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah
(Ooh, ooh)
Grasping to control
So I better hold on
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?

Carry On Wayward Son 
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more, no
Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
But surely heaven waits for you
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry, don't you cry no more
No more

Born in the U.S.A. 
Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just coverin' up
Born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
Born in the U.S.A. 
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
Born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says, "Son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, "Son, don't you understand"
I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A. 
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A. 
Born in the U.S.A. 
Born in the U.S.A. 
I'm a cool rockin' Daddy in the U.S.A. now

Proud Mary 
You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day

Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

Rolling on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Ya know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
Ya know the big wheel keep on turning

Zombie 
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra

I Love Rock ’N Roll
I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he musta been about 17
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me, singin'
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
"That don't matter," he said, "'cause it's all the same"
Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
And next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me, singin'
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
Next we were movin' on

Yeah, with me, singin'

Hit Me with Your Best Shot 
Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
That's okay, let's see how you do it
Put up your dukes, let's get down to it
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
You come on with it, come on, you don't fight fair
That's okay, see if I care
Knock me down, it's all in vain
I get right back on my feet again
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case
You better make sure you put me in my place
Hit me with your best shot
C'mon, hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot

Just a Girl 
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand
'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights
Oh, I've had it up to here
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear
'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be
Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to here

Hey Hey
You've got to listen the guitars
Yes i can feel it in my blood
The taste of old good rock n roll
The alcohol
You got to lose your boring side
Let out your devil stay alive
Just try to prove this tasty sin
And let me in
Hey hey
The motherfuckers want to turn it off
Hey hey
But there is nothing to make us stop
Hey hey
Turn loud the music baby
And i will bring this down
You got to lose your own control
Just come with me in ecstasy
Feel the vibration in your bones
Don’t be strong as stone
You got to kiss my flaming soul
Forget your proud take off your clothes
Just keep on dancing to the beat
Scream, baby, scream 

Adrenaline
Feel the adrenaline chasing through your veins
Gotta love the attention
I wanna feel the energy rising
I wanna feel this bass drum pounding
Through your skin, you take to the night
Like thunder and lightning
Let's own this night
Just you and me, boy
Let me hear you scream
Hey...
Hey...
I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet
Take take take me anywhere you want me
I wanna feel you play
With my heart
Grasp anything you want
I love to feel this pain
Hey...
Ooh...
I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You lookеd over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet
I can't hеlp but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet!
I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet
I can't help but feel...
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard!
At your feet

Because the Night 
Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust

Cherry Bomb 
Can't stay at home, can't stay in school
Old folks say, "You poor little fool"
Down the street, I'm the girl next door
I'm the fox you've been waiting for
Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb
Hello, world, I'm your wild girl

Stone Age love and strange sounds too
Come on, baby, let me get to you
Bad nights causin' teenage blues
Get down, ladies, you got nothin' to lose
Hello, Daddy, hello, Mom
I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, cherry bomb

Have you and grab you 'til you're sore

Mayhem 
He said he didn’t even hear trains let alone the few words
The ladies maybe sayin’ about him
She freaks and tells her closest friend that she’ll never love again
But she’ll never, no not ever
Live without him
Wouldn’t believe it, if you seen it
Oh, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta Mayhem, woh oh oh yeah
She said he didn’t mean a thing so she threw her diamond ring
Out the window of a black cab in Camden
He couldn’t take it, what she did
So he threw a hissy fit and he took it out on anyone at random
Wouldn’t believe it, if you seen it
Oh, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta Mayhem, woh oh oh yeah
Dinning sound, lights spinning round, some mothers’ son
Gotta fight or got to run run run run
Run run run run run
Ten pints and then he starts a fight and he lands himself a night
In a cell wearing grey pants and bruises
Twelve mates bangin’ on the door, oh the back up vans galore
Never saw such a street full of losers

Drugstore Rock and Roll 
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
Drugstore on the corner of main
That's where you find all the bebop gang
The girls fill the jukebox and then demand
The jitterbug hand-in-hand
The boys have crew-cuts under their hats
The girls have leather sweaters, real cool cats
They're always together happy an' hep
Jumpin' to a rock 'n' roll step
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll

Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
The records have a slow beat, a fast beat too
As long as they're rockin' any beat will do
Kittens gettin' groovy all over the floor
And the cats are cryin' for more
Take time out for a soda pop
Dig a new record with a lot of bop
Ice cream cones and banana split
Ten jumps ahead of a fit
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll

Stay High 
I already feel like doing it again, honey
'Cause once you know, then you know
And you don't wanna go
Back to wherever it is that you come from, yeah
I just want to stay high with you
'Cause where I come from
Everybody frowns and walks around
With that ugly thing on their face
And where I come from
We work hard and grind and hustle all day
(Yes, we do)
There comes a time, there comes a time
At night where we get to play
And we smile and laugh and jump and clap
And yell and holler and just feel great
I just want to stay high with you
With you, with you, baby
So don't question my state of mind
I'm doing wonderful, just fine, thank you
(Thank you)
Everything is everything and everything is beautiful
(How did you get like that?)
See, all I do is keep it cool and don't worry 'bout what everyone is doing
I already feel like doing it again, honey
I just want to stay high
I just want to stay high
I just want to stay high with you

Still into You 
Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time, I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)
I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you

Sk8er Boi 
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
I see the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'm with the skater boy (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I said, "See you later, boy" (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be backstage after the show (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be at our studio (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Singin' the song we wrote (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
About a girl you used to know (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'm with the skater boy (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I said, "See you later, boy" (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be backstage after the show (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be at our studio (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Singin' the song we wrote (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
About a girl you used to know

Clock is ticking while I'm killing time
Spinning all around
Nothing else that you can do to turn it back
Wicked partnership in this crime
Ripping off the best
Condescending smile
Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth
Go on, tease me
Clock is ticking while I'm stealing time
Can't you turn it back?
Stop the cycle, set it free and run away
Silent sneaking along my path
Rugged the road but we
Feel it like we're flyin'
(Feel it like we're flyin'...)
Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth
Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)

Kiss Me Deadly 
I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid
I got in a fight
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
Late for my job
And the traffic was bad
Had to borrow ten bucks from my old man
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
I went to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story
It'd be alright
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me deadly
Had a few beers
Getting high
Sitting, watching the time go by
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
Nothing to eat and no TV
Looking in the mirror
Don't get it for me
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me

Seether 
Ow!
Seether is neither loose nor tight
Seether is neither black nor white
I tried to keep her on a short leash
I tried to calm her down
I tried to ram her into the ground, yeah
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Seether is neither big nor small
Seether is the center of it all
I tried to rock her in my cradle
I tried to knock her out
I tried to cram her back in my mouth, yeah
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Keep her down, boiling water
Keep her down, what a lovely daughter
Oh, she is not born like other girls
But I know how to conceive her
Oh, she may not look like other girls
But she's a snarl-toothed seether, seether!
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Seether

Lucky Lips 
When I was just a little girl with long and silky curls
My mama told me: "Honey, you got more than other girls!
Now you may not be good looking, but you'll soon wear diamond clips
And you'll never have to worry, 'cause you've got lucky lips!"
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true!
I don't need a four-leave clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!
(With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!)
I never get heartbroken, no, I never get the blues
And if I play the game of love, I know I just can't lose
When they spin that wheel of fortune, all I do is kiss my chips
And I know I'm picked a winner, 'cause I've got lucky lips!
And I know I'm bound to win, yeah, 'cos I've got lucky lips!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true!
I don't need a four-leave clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!

When Will I Be Loved 
I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
Tell me, when will I be loved?

I Can’t Make You Love Me 
Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

Fade Into You 
I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you when I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colored your eyes with what's not there
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew

It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
