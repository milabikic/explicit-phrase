Creep
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

Something in the Way
Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped, have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass, and the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm

Basket Case 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?
And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah
(Ooh, ooh)
Grasping to control
So I better hold on
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?

Proud Mary 
You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river

Zombie 
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra

Just a Girl 
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand
'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights
Oh, I've had it up to here
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear
'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be
Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to here

Seether 
Ow!
Seether is neither loose nor tight
Seether is neither black nor white
I tried to keep her on a short leash
I tried to calm her down
I tried to ram her into the ground, yeah
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Seether is neither big nor small
Seether is the center of it all
I tried to rock her in my cradle
I tried to knock her out
I tried to cram her back in my mouth, yeah
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Keep her down, boiling water
Keep her down, what a lovely daughter
Oh, she is not born like other girls
But I know how to conceive her
Oh, she may not look like other girls
But she's a snarl-toothed seether, seether!
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth, yeah

I Can’t Make You Love Me 
Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

Fade Into You 
I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you when I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colored your eyes with what's not there
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew

Gin and Juice

But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (But what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this

Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo

And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in

You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money

Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo

All the love that we shared
I realized that most of the time
You were just not there, oh uuh
It was hard for me to see when
When your love was blinding me
But now I know I have to let you
Go your separate way, uuh
Things will never be the same
'Cause baby, baby you did me wrong
Hurt so bad I can't move on
Was it worth all your pain
'Cause, baby you've got to pay
Got to learn the hard way
It's a shame you had to learn to hard way
(It's a shame)
Now I have to take my love away
(Uh uh uh uhh)
You see I could've made it easy
(Made it easy)
For you to become a part of me
(Oh oh oh oh)
It's a shame you had to learn to hard way
(It's a shame)
Now I have to take my love away
(Oh oh oh oh)
You see I could've made it easy
(Ooh)
For you to become a part of me
(Uh uh uh uhh)
It's a shame you had to learn to hard way
(Learn the hard way)
Now I have to take my love away
(Take my love away, take my love away)
You see I could've made it easy
('Cause it hurts so bad)
For you to become a part of me
(It's a shame, it's a shame)
It's a shame you had to learn to hard way
(Yeah)
Now I have to take my love away
(Take my love away)
You see I could've made it easy
(Uuh uh uuh)
For you to become a part of me
Things will never be the same
'Cause baby, baby you did me wrong
Hurt so bad I can't move on
Was it worth all your pain
'Cause, baby you've got to pay
Got to learn the hard way
It's a shame you had to learn to hard way
(Hii iih)
Now I have to take my love away
(My love away)
You see I could've made it easy
(I've gone so low)
For you to become a part of me
It's a shame you had to learn to hard way
(Shame you learn the hard way, now I take my love away)
Now I have to take my love away
You see I could've made it easy
(Made it easy)
For you to become a part of me
(You did me wrong)
It's a shame you had to learn to hard way
(You told me lies)
Now I have to take my love away
(Treated me bad)
You see I could've made it easy
(All of the time)
For you to become a part of me
It's a shame you had to learn to hard way
(Uuhuh ahh)
Now I have to take my love away
(Take my love away)
You see I could've made it easy
(Made it easy, babe)
For you to become a part of me
Part of me

Together Again
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
I'll never forget you
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
When I feel that I don't belong
Draw my strength from the words when you said
"Hey, it's about you, baby"
Look deeper inside you, baby
Dream about us together again
What I want: us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again, 'cause
Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star shinin' down on me
Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh)
Makes me wanna dance
Say it loud and proud
(Together again, ooh)
All my love's for you
Always been a true angel to me - now above
I can't wait for you to wrap your wings around me, baby
(Wrap them around me, baby)
Wrap them around me, baby
(Wrap them around me, baby)
Sometimes hear you whisperin', "No more pain"
No worries will you ever see now, baby
(Ever see now, baby)
I'm so happy for my baby
(Happy for you, baby)
Dream about us together again
What I want: us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again, 'cause
Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star shinin' down on me
Good times we'll share again
(Together again, ooh)
Makes me wanna dance
Say it loud and proud
(Together again)
All my love's for you
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel you smile upon me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
What I'd give just to hold you close as on earth
In heaven, we will be together, baby
(Together)
Together again, my baby (together again, my baby)
Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star shinin' down on me
Everywhere I go, every smile I see
I know you are there smilin' back at me
Dancin' in moonlight, I know you are free
'Cause I can see your star shinin' down on me

Still Under The Weather
My first lesson losing a love was you
Learning to live with your memory was lesson number two
I can't lie, baby
I still cry sometimes
But I've come a long way
Towards gettin' you out of my mind
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
I still miss the shelter
Of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me
Has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
Sometimes your memory still gets the best of me
But that lonely ache in my heart
Ain't as bad as it used to be
Sometimes the way that I'm feelin'
Inside doesn't show
But I know
I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
And I still miss the shelter
Of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me
Has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm

The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said, "Hello"
He said, "Hi, what's new?"
And Wo said, "Sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt"
Said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth"
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself"
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home 'cause he didn't live far, you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot, just to flag 'em down
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?"
The judge said "guilty" on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said, "Supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it"
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister don't miss when she aims her gun
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
