Early Morning Breeze
I open up my door to greet the early morning sun
Closing it behind me and away I do run
To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees
To have a word with God in the early morning breeze
A rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze

Jackson Ain’t a Very Big Town
Tonight at night we get married my friends all say it's a shame and disgrace
And he's loved every woman in Jackson oh but Jackson ain't a very big place
Tomorrow we'll go walking I count each one with a tear on her face
Then I'll know just how many think I'm lucky cause Jackson ain't a very big place
Jackson is a mighty small town where the gossips and the rumors go round
But the gossips are the ones he turned down and Jackson ain't a very big town
Jackson is a mighty small town

Gunpowder And Lead
County road two thirty-three under my feet
Nothin' on this white rock but little ol' me
I've got two miles 'til he makes bail
And if I'm right, we're headed straight for hell
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead
Well, it's half past ten, another six-pack in
And I can feel the rumble like the cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waiting here this time
Hey, I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead
His fist is big, but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and, gunpowder and lead
Gunpowder and lead, yeah, yeah
Hey


You're Supposed To Be Feeling Good
Soulmate, I see you down there
Waiting for morning to softly be coming
I find I'm only in deeper and you'd be a leaver
If you weren't so scared
Your true love has made you feel better
But look out for later when she makes you feel worse
Times change in daydreams and flashes
A taste of the past is all I have seen
But you're supposed to be feeling good now
'Cause everybody said you would
Honey, does it blow your mind that the prophets would lie?
Well, you're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Feeling like you're down and out over someone like me
Soulmate, the blues are deceiving
It keeps us believing we're on the wrong road
One side is just like the other
Except for the color and size of the load
And just how much it shows
But you're supposed to be feeling good now
'Cause everybody said you would
Oh honey, does it blow your mind that the prophets would lie?
You're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Just feeling like you're down and out over someone like me


Don’t Call Me
If you get yourself in another one of your binds
Run for help, yell for someone, pray for a sign
Dial 911, light a roadside flare
Up and run, I don't care
Just don't, don't call me
If your truck breaks down, if it all falls apart
Leave it on the shoulder, just get out, take a walk
If your shoes hurt your feet, take 'em off
Probably do ya some good, hell, maybe a lot
Just don't, don't call me
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
If you wake up in jail and they let you use the phone
Even if mine's the only number you know
You gotta figure it out on your own
You used up your favours a long time ago
So don't, well don't call me
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
Oh no you don't!
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
Oh you don't call me
don't call me!
(Pick up a book and get self help) that's right, you don't call me!
(1800, go to hell, there's always been someone else) don't call me!
No, no, no (you can lean on your other ex)
(I know y'all still text) don't call me!
(Call your mom, she'll fix your mess) don't call me!
(Call your doctor!) You don't call me!
(Your lawyer if you can afford one) don't call me!
(Lose my number, don't call Brandi, and don't call me)
don't call me
(Your tattoo artist; somebody else can get this party started)

Greener Pasture
Ooh oh ooh
I'm sittin' on the front porch, cigarette burnin'
Them makers in my coffee sure ain't workin'
I see the dirt from where his boots used to lay
Still phantom pains after a couple a days
And I wonder if he ever thought about turnin' around
Bet he's past El Paso by now
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture (ooh)
Bet he's rollin' through a new town, and she's fallin' for his accent
She don't know that he's a dust cloud, he's beautifully tragic
He stays for the night, but he's gone by the morning
Let him ruin your life like a Tennessee storm
And this shouldn't tear you up, break you down this bad
Lovin' something you never had
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture
And all that ever mattered, livin' hard and livin' faster
Freedom was a dagger to a knife holder
There ain't no ever after, you're special, then you're shattered
Damn, he's got a way of leavin' his mark
Yeah, I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture (ooh)
But cowboys always find a greener pasture

Still Under The Weather
My first lesson losing a love was you
Learning to live with your memory was lesson number two
I can't lie, baby
I still cry sometimes
But I've come a long way
Towards gettin' you out of my mind
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
I still miss the shelter
Of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me
Has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
Sometimes your memory still gets the best of me
But that lonely ache in my heart
Ain't as bad as it used to be
Sometimes the way that I'm feelin'
Inside doesn't show
But I know
I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
And I still miss the shelter
Of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me
Has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm

Dooley's Farm
Old Dooley was raised Carolina
Got his schoolin' out in Vietnam
Tucks his hair up in a Pioneer seed cap
When he's bringing his cash crop in
Everybody said he's just a simpleton farmer
Plow a hundred acres out in Sugar Grove
Smilin' at you from an IH tractor
But there's a secret down in every row
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
Old Dooley's got a roadside farm stand
Sweet corn, tomatoes, and turnip greens
But if you ask to buy a jug of sorghum
He'll know exactly what you mean
He'll meet you in the back of the woods at midnight
Bring a lantern cause it's hard to find
He's got a strain that'll punch your lights out
Old Dooley's gonna blow your mind
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
You can hide by day but the night will find you
They caught Dooley in the moonlight
Drug him down from the field to the state farm
To bust rocks on the roadside
Now everybody says I'm just a simpleton farmer
But they don't know that I'm an outlaw
Growing green must've ran in the family
Cause old Dooley is my grandpa
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco then they made moonshine
But there's something better in the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco then they made moonshine
But there's something better in the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm

Your Drinkin', My Problem
Four a.m., stumbled to the bedroom again
'Cause I know where you're goin', you won't say where you've been
It was the bloodshot eyes that gave it away
Yeah, it's never my tab but I always pay
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Must be nice sleepin' 'til 11 o'clock like a rock
You lie to my face, not an ounce of shame in your walk
Oh, for the sake of my health, let's say that we're done
'Cause I feel like hell every time you get drunk
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Well, you can count me out for your next round
'Cause your livin' it up is bringin' me down
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
Yeah, I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Yeah, I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Yeah, my problem

The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said, "Hello"
He said, "Hi, what's new?"
And Wo said, "Sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt"
Said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth"
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself"
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home 'cause he didn't live far, you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot, just to flag 'em down
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?"
The judge said "guilty" on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said, "Supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it"
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister don't miss when she aims her gun
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Give It Time
I was going through the drawer at an old antique store
When a note on a page caught my eye
Words, they were sad, made my insides feel bad
Like it spoke from the man that I adore
He was moving on, he spent most of his nights gone
And I knew our love was ending
To this very day, I still get tears in my eyes
For the words that he never said
Give it time, write some letters
Give it time, you'll feel better
Soon I will fade from your mind
Give it time, no more sleepless nights
Give it time, you'll find the one that's right
You think that you still need me, give it time
And if you think that it won't last
You're probably just livin' in the past
And if you need someone to help you get through the night
Go out there, go ahead, find the light
And if you need some place to go, you're with me we'll go slow
To this very day, I still get tears in my eyes
For the words that he never said
Give it time, write some letters
Give it time, you'll feel better
Soon I will fade from your mind
Oh, give it time, no more sleepless nights
Give it time, you'll find the one that's right
You think that you still need me, just give it time

Hard As This
If you need space Take a trip Hijack you a ride on a rocket ship Hang out with the constellations Get yourself some isolation babe 
If you need time Here's a clock You can sit alone at night and listen to it tic and toc When it stops just wind it up 
I'll be somewhere giving up on you All my love is wasted on nothin but a heart ache in my chest You know how much 
I hate it Cause baby your the one who does it best Love shouldn't be so hard Hard as this If you need to think 
Read a book Read about some thief Stealing hearts like a crook See yourself there in the plot 
Realize you've got a lot to lose All my love is wasted on nothin but a heart ache in my chest You know how much 
I hate it Cause baby your the one who does it best Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard Hard as this 
All my love is wasted on nothin but a heart ache in my chest 
But honey you'll be aching to Cause I might be the one that you'll regret
Oh I coulda been the one for you but Lately I don't know what we got left Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard
Oh love shouldn't be so hard Hard as this

I Can't Love You Anymore
Shoulda known what I was getting in
Fallin' for a boy from Michigan
You love your mom like every Midwest kid
You like driving to Texas
You put up with all my exes
To deserve you, don't know what the hell I did
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
Bring me coffee every morning
You're fun even when you're boring
And you like me even when I've been a bitch
You watch me while I'm gettin' ready
You lighten up my heavy
You're so good lookin' it kinda makes me sick
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk you down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now, aye, aye
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You're the angel to my devil
The pot to my kettle
To some I might be an acquired taste
You tell me I'm your favorite person
Hey, what we've got is working
And the years have only made it more that way
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
Heaven knows that I've attempted
Couldn't even put a dent in
I can't love you any more than I do now

Heart Like A Truck
I never stay in one place too long
A dirt road's singing me a siren song
I gotta find a field
I need to spin my wheels
I got a hankering for four wide tires
And I can't help it it's the way I'm wired
'Fore you get too close
Boy you need to know
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
There ain't no breaking when I throw it in drive
Don't always keep it in between the lines
If you're ready for a ride pedal down state of mind
Boy I tell you what
You better buckle up
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
Go on and see if you can knock off the dust yea
Shine it up revv it up and let it run yea
It gets a high riding off into the sun yea
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline

A little bit of love is all that it's needing

Truth No. 2
You don't like the sound of the truth
Comin' from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well, baby that might be so
I might get to the end of my life
Find out everyone was lyin'
I don't think that I'm afraid anymore
Say that I would rather die tryin'
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
This time when he swung the bat
And I found myself layin' flat I wondered
What a way to spend a dime
What a way to use the time, ain't it baby?
I looked at my reflection in the window walkin' past
And I saw a stranger
Just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
Why the world's dangerous
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
You don't like the sound of the truth
Comin' from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well, baby that might be so
Tell me what's wrong with havin' a little faith
In what you're feeling in your heart
Why must we be so afraid
And always so far apart?
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips

Big Family
It's bunk beds and matching sheets
Sharin' the bathroom sink
Fist fightin' over window seats all the way to KOA
It's more cousins than we have friends
A piggyback pyramid to fit us all in
And squintin' through a Polaroid lens on Thanksgiving Day
We learned how to ration apple pie
And how to dirty dance when Aunt Tina had too much wine
It's all husbands and ex-wives and boyfriends and pink lines
And the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family
It's "Hurry up" and "Wait your turn" and
Eat it all even if it's burned
It don't take too long to learn that the world don't revolve around you
We're a picture frame patchwork
Roots tangled in the same dirt
Little baggage, little hard work
It's all worth its weight
In husbands and ex-wives and boyfriends and pink lines
And the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family, ooh
Big family
We're thick skinned and stubborn
'Til the day we're six feet under
It's the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family, ooh
Big family, yeah
Big family

Matches and Metaphors
It's raining at my house, is it raining at yours?
When it rains it pours, to hell with the metaphors.
I want you so bad I think I might die
I'm sorry I keep feeding you these lines, but
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
I wrote you a letter. I threw it in the trash.
Got it out lit it with a match.
I'm not gonna tell you how I feel,
It's overrated but damn, it's real
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
If you don't want me, that don't bother me at all.
Don't be upset if I don't answer when you call.
Maybe I can move on, but there was nothing to move on from.
My veins are on fire, babe my face is numb
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
It's raining at my house, is it raining at yours

I've Been Loving You Too Long
I've been loving you too long to stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me
I've been loving you, a little too long
I don't wanna stop now
With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, our affair grows old
I've been loving you much too long
To stop now
I've been loving you much too long
I don't wanna stop now
Oh, please don't make me stop now
Oh, please I can't stop now
I've been loving you too long

Merry Go 'Round
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday mornin', you best be there
In the front row like you're supposed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary quite contrary
We get bored, so we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
We think the first time's good enough
So, we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want, it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction
'Cause mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored, so, we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

Back in Baby’s Arms
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Don't know why we quarrel
We never did before
Since we found out how it hurt
I bet we never quarrel anymore
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Thought I didn't need his love
Till he took it away
Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms

If Trouble Comes a Lookin’
What is there in Little Rock at the Hilton Double Tree
Just a woman far from home a thousand miles out to sea
She walks over to the window, pulls the curtain shut
Pours three fingers of whiskey in a flimsy plastic cup
Sits down on the bedspread, takes off her wedding ring
If she does something dark enough he might just set her free
It's her mother's mother's diamond in a shining golden band
Another woman who spent most her life loving the wrong man
If trouble comes a' lookin' she won't be hard to find
She's sitting in the hotel bar on her second glass of wine
She put a pretty dress on, wiped the tears out of her eyes
And if trouble comes a'lookin she won't be hard to find
Just two floors down is Brother John from Our Lady of Grace
He is older now but handsome still with such a lonely face
He picked a hotel off the Interstate where even God won't find him
Runs his fingers through the rosary and locks the door behind him
How was Christ so perfect, how on earth did he resist
The perfume on a woman's neck, the softness of her lips
He burned and burned for years with the fire of devotion
But some things are impossible to stop once they're in motion
If trouble comes a'lookin' he won't be hard to find
He's sitting in the hotel bar on his second glass of wine
Across the empty room he glances up to meet her eyes
And if trouble comes a lookin' he won't be hard to find
At quarter til the bartender will make the final call
She'll slip down off her stool and sway slowly down the hall
And he'll kiss her like she always wanted, back against the wall
And she'll step out of her dress looking like Eve before the fall
If trouble comes a lookin they won't be hard to find
They're tangled in each other's arms in room 229
They've never strayed this far into the shadows of the night
And if trouble comes a' lookin' they won't be hard to find
Not every infidelity is bound to end in shame
She'll smile one month later when a letter bears his name
Brother John has gone to France and Italy to travel
Where all of his ideas of God will happily unravel

Red Dress
Last night I ached and pleaded for candlelight and you
Walked the floor 'til midnight and cried ’til half past two
Then you come in with a flimsy grin and a flimsier excuse
With your shirt just reeking of cheap perfume and stale vermouth
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get me a new red dress and go out and paint the town
Get out on the dance floor, strut them curves around
And we’ll just see who thinks that I'm a ragged hand me down
Lately when you look at me, you been seeing a trinity
Your mama, the Irish washer woman and a whore from gay Paree
But I'm from Enid, Oklahoma and my name is not Marie
And I don't like the aroma of your third hand ecstasy
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get my new red dress and go out and paint the town
Hem line slit high on the thigh, lots of cleavage to bounce around
And we'll just see who thinks that I'm a ragged hand me down
I don’t like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I’m gonna get my new red dress and go out and paint the town
I just got one life to live and then I'm six feet under ground
And I don’t think I'm gonna live it as a ragged hand me down
You'll have to wash your own shirts now and hang 'em out on your line of balderdash
Take your hot stuff and your pickup truck down to First Street and pay cash
I ain’t the socket for your rocket, babe, I ain't your playtime clown
And I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get me a new red dress and go out and paint the town
Gonna find someone to love me and what's in that scarlet gown
Someone who knows there's a lot more in it than a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna find someone to love me and what's in that scarlet gown
Someone who knows there's a lot more in it than a ragged hand me down

Sober & Skinny
Oh-oh-oh
Wow-oh-oh-oh
I empty the fridge
You empty the bottle
We're stacking up a mountain of hard pills
We'll have to swallow
It's strange how we point
I've lost it one another
We both got different vices
And they lead us to each other
Cause you owe the drink and I over eat
We're under thinking everything
And every night we swear it's gonna change
But in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Write the checks that we can cash
Keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (hmm-mmm)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (yeah, mmm)
You want being a shrink
While I think we should talk to one
Find a comfy couch and let out all the hurt
We've kept inside since we were young
That's so numb
Now we found ways to cover up
If we keep going out
We're going while we become
Cause in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Writing checks that we can cash
An keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, oh, oh
It's easy to imagine, imagine
All our problems disappear like magic, magic
But even on this world
You're not sober, I'm not skinny
We scraping by old borrowed pennies
Writing checks that'll never cash
Breaking all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
Maybe we'll grow old together
Waking up by our happy ending
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh, oh)
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
You'll get sober, I'll get skinny
It's easy to imagine
It's easy to imagine

Promises, Promises
You've promised you would be true to me but we both know you could never be
You've been puttin' you on since the day we met
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Then you promised me a ring a weddin' gown and all of them things
But I ain't seen no diamond yet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met you break my heart in two again I'll bet
But promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
And now you tell me you've gone away you swear to me that this time you'll stay
But I can't believe that I'm rid of you yet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met you break my heart in two again I'll bet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met...

He Wasn't Man Enough
Darkchild
Oh, yeah, yeah
Ha-ha, uh-huh
Yeah, uh, uh
Darkchild, yeah

Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first?

What you thinkin'?
Stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance

And not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worryin' about me
And hopefully you won't find
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

What you thinkin'?
Stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance
See, I've already had your man

I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me

Oh yeah
So many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense 'cause he will never change
Girl, you better recognize the game, oh yeah

What are you thinking?

When It Rains It Pours
Sunday morning, man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinkin' that her leavin'
Is the only logical reason
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Springsteen
To this day, when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut off jeans
Somewhere between that settin' sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
We were just gettin' started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh"
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you
I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
Still be a spark
And back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what would mama think
'Bout your name on my arms
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound, roll the beat of a drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear "Born in the USA"
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me
Do you think about 17?
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky?
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Oh, Springsteen

Barefoot Blue Jean Night
A full moon shinin' bright
Edge of the water, we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and an old guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught up in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Whoa-oh, never gonna grow up, ha
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night

Head Over Boots
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah
So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
Yeah, I'm here to pick you up
And I hope I don't let you down, no, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll

Drunk On A Plane
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
Hmm, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim, hmm
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane

Toes
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther
I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for Tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play
The four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid goodbye to my friends
Because my bartender she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the Rum
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the people they call me Big Poppa
When I throw pesos their way
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jäger
And I'll grab my guitar and play
Going home now to stay
The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to stay
Going home now to stay
And put my ass in a lawn chair
Toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
Life is good today
Life is good today

Do I Make You Wanna
Baby what's on your mind?
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can get lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind?
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now

Girl, when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Karaoke in the neon light
Go to Vegas, stay up all night
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little seven, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show?
Or maybe just stay low?
I gotta know now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now
Act just like you don't care now
Girl when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now?
We can take it back downtown

Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find

Play a little truth or dare now
Act just like you don't care now
Girl when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon? Broadway?
Tell me do I make you wanna
Stay up 'til the sun?
Howl at the moon?
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
(Let your hair down)
Yeah (Play a little truth or dare now)
Ye-e-yeah-eh (Act just like you don't care now)
Baby
Go flyin' down a two lane road
A limb to hang your clothes on (Oh)
Huh babe, tell me do I make you wanna

Wagon Wheel
Headin' down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-gettin' me down
Lost my money playin' poker, so I had to leave town
But I ain't a-turnin' back to livin' that old life no more
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Yeah, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke
But he's a-headin' west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I died in Raleigh, at least I will die free
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Oh, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel (oh, I wanna feel)
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me

Girl Like You
Love how you close your eyes
When I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah, you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top

Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you

Hometown Girl
She grew up around here on that southwest side
Where the corn grows up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night
She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot where she came from
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl


Tennessee Whiskey
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

Knockin’ Boots
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me across town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey

Last calls needa call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

Speakers, Bleachers And Preachers
You had a blue jean jacket, a burned CD
Said you wanna go somewhere fast with me
I picked you up
Yeah, and we turned it up
You had a broke heart necklace
Post-game smile
J Town front page news for awhile
Then we broke up
But I still turned it up
Cheerleading skirts and backseats
Free throws and church marquees
Kingsley countdown radio
Wouldn't know nothing if it weren't for all those
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss
The faster the car, more money you burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Story of my youth
Speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growin' up to do
Kroger parkin' lot, battle scars
Black and Mild on the dash under the stars
If Daddy asks they ain't mine
82 degrees on the bank sign
And hey, hey, summer jams
Any Chesney song gonna make her dance
When the sun goes down, yeah
I'll think about her now
And all those
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss

Story of my youth
Speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growin' up to do
Subs from my system
Rattlin' my rearview
Used to listen with my cousin
I miss him, he's gone now
It was the national anthem
And a knee-down prayer we were actin'
Like we weren't just like every other small town
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss
The faster the car, more money you burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers

The Way I Talk
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it, them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheering on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man, it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Yeah it's, Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now
Fighting words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact, I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know
I sound a little bit like my daddy
I don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk

Loud and Heavy
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Pistons pumping
Minds are racing
It's hard to sleep, man
When I'm shaking
Bad news surrounds me
It's always found me
Creeping up when things are good
Yeah, the dark days find a way
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
The camra captures
All the things that
Make us turn from
What we see
It's always moving
It don't stop rolling
I haven't slept in three damn days
Yeah, but who needs that anyway?
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Loud thunder heavy rain
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
A long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Loud thunder heavy rain

Plain to See Plainsman
I cut through the Rockies like some unholy blade
The icy depths of the Pacific I have bade
Forever I wander, forever I stray
The rustle of wheat fields starts callin' my name
Callin' my name
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home
Well the North-folk are dandy, they don't mind the cold
The South has filled up both my belly and soul
I know when I'm gray and I know when I'm old
These bones will cry out for the place they were born
Place they were born
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home
I've met beautiful women, a pleasure to see
Road-bitten bikers and barefoot hippies
Junkies and saints on my travels I greet
But far too few are homesick young plainsmen like me
Plainsmen like me
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home


I Love This Life
I love my boots broke in, I love my Camo hat
Don't mind a little paint on my jeans, yeah I roll like that
I love driving my truck across the railroad tracks
If you hit it too quick, it'll hit ya right back
I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on
How it shines like gold when the sun turned on
I love the sound of them wheels with my baby singing along
When "The Boys Of Summer" comes on
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rollin' through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
I Love that county line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she's been sipping that wine
I still get drunk on her every time
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through mind
Man, I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
I love that ragged old barn that my grandpa made
It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church, out on 109
It's where I hit my knees and thank the Lord for this life of mine
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life

Heaven
Mmm
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced

Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time


Telling on My Heart
Check out the moonlight filling up the night sky
Girl, how many times that you me sat right here
It always seems to get too late
Something tells me that I oughta wait
So while I got my courage up, and my mind still clear
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
Sayin' all kinds of crazy things
Like you're the only girl for me
Oh, baby, it was meant to be
And it just feels right
Yeah, how I think about you all the time
I can't seem to keep you off my mind
Kissing ain't the only thing I wanna do to you tonight
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
You know those secrets I've been keeping
Way down deep inside of me
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
'Cause I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I wanna tell you what I think
Underneath these stars
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart


Live Like You Were Dying
He said
"I was in my early forties
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the x-rays
And talkin' 'bout the options
And talkin' 'bout sweet time"
I asked him
"When it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit you
When you get that kind of news?
Man, what'd you do?"
And he said
"I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying"
He said
"I was finally the husband
That most of the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden going fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I, I finally read the Good Book, and I
Took a good, long, hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then
I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
Like tomorrow was a gift
And you've got eternity
To think about
What you'd do with it
What could you do with it
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?
Skydiving
I went Rocky mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
Man, I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying"
Woo


God's Country
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (yeah)
God's country
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country)
Yeah, I saw the light in the sunrise

Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine

Runnin’ Outta Moonlight
Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up, you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust that's my headlights, that's my truck
Come on baby, don't you keep me waitin'

Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms
Whoa, girl every now and then you get a night like this

Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
Girl I bet you thought I lost my mind
Outta the blue pulling into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear
Whoa, girl you never look better than you do right now
Whoa, oh heaven let your light shine down
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight

Beer in Mexico
Starin' out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and the lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should I try to grow up?
But who knows where to start
So I'll just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen 'em both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just tryin' to search my soul
For all the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go
So I'll just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Maybe I'll settle down, get married
Or stay single and stay free
Which road I'll travel is still a mystery to me
So I'll just sit right here, have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Down in Mexico


Burn Out
Watching cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts, how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
The smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done me wrong songs hit me so right
I'm so on fire for you it hurts, how
Fast as one cigarette can burn out
If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
It's a smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done me wrong songs hit me so right
I'm so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
