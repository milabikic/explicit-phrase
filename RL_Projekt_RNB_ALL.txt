PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA
Boy, I know you can't help but to be yourself 'round me
Yourself 'round me, now
And I know nobody's perfect, so I'll let you be, I'll let you be
It's the way you wear your emotions on both of your sleeves, ah-ah-ah
To the face you make when I tell you that I have to leave, ooh-ooh
But I like it, baby, ooh, I like it, baby
But I like it, baby, baby, but I like it, baby
Ah, we don't need the world's acceptance
They're too hard on me, they're too hard on you, boy
I'll always be your secret weapon in your arsenal, your arsenal
And I know you had it rough growing up, but that's okay (that's okay)
I like it rough (that's okay, baby)
Even when you let your feelings get in the way (let your feelings get in the way)
I still like it, baby, ooh, I like it, baby (like it, baby)
But I like it, baby (like it, baby)
Baby, baby (like it, baby)
I still like it, baby, baby, baby, baby
Say, say you won't change
I love the little things that make you, you
Ooh, the rest of the world is strange
Stay in our lane, just you and me, and our family
I think you're so cool (even though I'm cooler than you)
Boy, I love that you can't help but be yourself around me
Yourself around me
Sugar, well you're trippin', I know we'll make up and make love
So I'll let you be, I'll let you be
It's the way you listen when I'm cryin'
You let me lean in
It's the way you want one more kiss after you said you were leavin'
But I like it, baby (yes, I like it, baby, yes, I like it baby)
Yes, I like it, baby (like it, baby)
Like it, I like it, I love it, baby
I like it, baby
I like it, I love it, baby
I like it, baby (I like it, ooh, like it, I like it, yeah)
I like, like it, baby
I like it, baby
Oh, I like it, baby
Baby, come on over (ooh, I like it, baby)
And I need you, baby
Baby (na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na)

Anything
Maybe I should kill my inhibition
Maybe I'll be perfect in a new dimension
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson, ooh
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do-do-do, down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will
Keeping up is hard to do
Even harder feeling heavy, steady chasing you
Beep beep, why are you looking around, you lonely?
I feel you coming down like honey
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson, ooh
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do-do-do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do you know I'm alive?
Do you even know?

It's safe to say that we might even be falling in love

Small Reminders
Time is racing (yeah, yeah)
Life seems so long (so long, hey, uh)
Don't go wasting
Before it's all gone
Never stop, never quit, never that (never that)
Promises that I make to myself (yeah)
Big drip so I stay in my bag (big drip)
Bad bitch, make a hater so mad (woo)
Lookin' up, there's snakes in the grass
Don't mix, so I stay on my own
When I get to the top it's a wrap
Ain't nobody tellin' me shit about shit
And that's that
Now or never
Perfect timing
I'll live forever
The stars keep shining
Love will find us
Don't go chasing
Small reminders
Time is racing
I spend fifty-five on the fill-up
Fill-up
I got the top down in the winter
Winter, it's windy
I keep the cookies and the doobie lit up
Lit up, uh
I'm dodgin' police, gotta duck tonight
Tonight
And I'm hella fly, push it up, feelin' soft
Wonderful, rolling up the weed and
I live it up, goin' through the ceilin' now
Came back, do a three-peat, Michael Jordan
Uh, I got the dream and I see it clearer
Before my head ever hit the pillow
I paid my dues and I feel like enough is enough
And enough is enough, and enough is enough, and enough is enough
Goin' so dumb
Goin' crazy
Losing count of
Blunts, still fancy
They say nothing lasts forever
Be in pain or be in pleasure
Nothing hurts me anymore unless I let it
We're the lucky ones
What do you dream about
When no one else is there to listen?
What do you wish for?
What do you care about?
Got so much weight all on your shoulders
You secretly carry around
You look in the mirror
When you think about your mistakes
Don't make a sound
Who are you really though?
When no one can convince you different
Do you even know?
If you could undo what you're going through
Would you?
Ooh, you and me


Shooter Interlude
And I'm keeping all this part too
Can I borrow some money?
Can you call me an Uber?
My mama needs surgery
And my son needs a scooter
Can you start up my start-up?
Can you move my maneuver?
I think you need Jesus
I think you need a shooter
So who you been fuckin'? Who you been foolin'?
How many bottles you got in your mini cooler?
S on your chest, but you never feel super
Do you ever feel stupid? Do you call out for Cupid?
Can I borrow your chains? Can I have your last name?
Can I come over later? And can I overstay my welcome?
Downplay the help, but don't say I ever
Borrowed your paper, don't forget the favors I did for you
Before you blew up
Knew you before you grew up
I used to babysit you, dated your baby sister
I wanted babies with you
Your daughter's supposed to be mine
Shouldn't have wasted your time
Put a ring on your finger
'Cause you've been dating lames
And all those famous names
Playin' those famous games
So can I borrow some money?
Call me an Uber
My mama needs surgery
And my son needs a scooter
Start up my start-up
Move my maneuver
I think you need Jesus
Think you need a shooter
Think you need a
Think you need a shooter
I think you need Jesus, huh
Think you need a shooter
I think you need

That's What I'm Here For

You should know by now how I feel
That my love is real
Feels secure knowing
You've got my heart in away
I can never stray
But now people talk
They say our love won't last (love won't last)
They say my love for you
Soon it will (past)
But you should no for sure
I will never leave, you're all the man I need
I hope you see

To be the only one you dream of

All that I have
I want to be there for you will you be there for me, for me
(Verse)
I'll be here to give you what you need
You can count on me - baby
Feels secure knowing
You've got my heart in a way
I can never stray
But now people talk
They say our love won't last (love won't last)
They say my love for you
Soon it will (past)
But you should no for sure
I will never leave, you're all the man I need
You can believe

(Rap)
Ya so moist
Plus you got the platinum voice
And you fine smelling like 360 Divine
You blow my mind away
Tonight and forever like diamonds al right
We tight like that
Stress time for chillin'
Times is short good and part
Cause you know you're my dime
The top illin'
They jealous cause me you styles killin'
ain't nothin' happenin' with that breakdown talk
We can walk the walk and keep it real
Like New York I'm sold up, you word up uh
If we just show'em I'll blow'em twice
And we'll just keep flowin' like Chardone'
On ice as we lounge in the crib and parle'
You know what I mean
Not to mention your lover supreme
Move's truly with throughout the evening
I'm here no question as long as I'm peepin' Illtown
Repeat Chorus Until Fade......

I know I'm too pretty to not do nothing with it
So I'ma move to Atlanta

And I know that somewhere near
So where's my millionaire
I just wanna be taken care of
'Cause I worked enough, karma's over love
I just wanna lay back, spend my baby money in his Maybach
I deserve that life
Be a damn good housewife
Two kids from a surrogate
Fly mama, I'ma stay fit, gettin' facelifts
Soccer mom, gettin' wasted (Wasted)
Hermès tennis bracelet (Bracelet)
Bora Bora for vacation
I'll be anything but basic
On the other side
On the other side

My Mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
Pretendin' I have the patience
Pretendin' there is enough time for waitin'
Rememberin' when we kept it all basic
I wanna go back so that I could taste it
What do I care for?
You were not there anymore
I was not careful
That is all your fault
You let me fall
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
Buried alive here inside a nightmare
Livin' a life where you're gone
There is no light here
It'll be light-years until my mind's clear (you're gone)
I did it all for love
I did it all
I'd trade it all for you
I'd trade it all
But what do I care for?
What are you here for?
If you're not there when I call?
I was not careful
And that's all your fault
You let me fall
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (in my mine)
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
This ain't how it's supposed to be
You and me supposed to be
Remember when it be just you and me
In your crib smokin' trees
Like you took control of me
You had a hold of me
Had me so gone, baby
Yeah, you had me givin' me all of me
Now it's all over, it's all done
Shouldn't have never told ya, you're the one
I'll be all right
I will be just fine
I'll be okay
Once you get out my mind
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (in my mine)
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
In my mine
In my mine, mine
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sunset Eyes
Feels like our love's in eclipse
It's like it has a different you to it
The room, the mood
The moonlight was dim
I know you felt that, right?
That night, I couldn't describe
The feeling when I saw the sunset in your eyes
'Cause I, I knew something wasn't right
The sight of us was fallin'
That night, I couldn't describe
The moment when I realized that it was time for us
To say that somethin' isn't right
The thought of us has faded away
Feels like we're forcing this
Even your touch has different weight to it
You kiss my lips and I'm indifferent
I didn't feel that high
That night (that night), I couldn't describe
The feeling when I saw the sunset in your eyes
'Cause I, I knew that something wasn't right
The sight of us was fallin'
That night, I couldn't describe
The moment when I realized that it was time for us
To say that somethin' isn't right
The thought of us has faded away

One
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No need, it's too late (would I have to suffer?)
Goddamn, this pressure is having me feeling frustrated
And all this bad weather followin' me like we datin'
Tryna be what they dream, what they fantasize
And still be me, me, myself at the same fuckin' time
And man, it's never been like this, I'm feelin' so faded
And not in the good way that you get from drinkin' Jamie
Tryna see where life leads, what the future lies
Anxiety all on me, keepin' me up at night
It's already rough dealin' with this stuff
Don't know if I'll move up, am I good enough?
One step at a time (hello), yeah (hello)
I've got to lighten up, stop being so tough
But when I make it up the way I dreamed of
Will I ever find it? (Hello, hey), yeah, yeah, yeah
And I don't know if I'll ever succeed
I just want you proud of me up above
(What you seek, you will find when you look inside)
(All these things on your mind, just a waste of time)
One thing I promise, I'll make you happy
Don't forget that I will never give up
Shit, it's been a week, only felt like a one day
Tryin' to get some sleep, time itself keeps on warpin'
You and me just ain't working right
Just like that, what a thing is to realize
Never call 'em back, pretty whack, that's my forté
Tryna get the stack, platinum racks, but the right way
All my love workin' overtime
And for what? Just to feel like I done missed my prime
It's already rough dealin' with this stuff
Don't know if I'll move up, am I good enough?
One step at a time, yeah (one step at a time, whoa)
I've got to lighten up, stop being so tough
But will I make it up the way I dreamed of?
Will I ever find it? (Will I ever find it?)
And I don't know if I'll ever succeed

Cranes in the Sky
I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair
I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder
I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away, away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Well, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
I tried to run it away
Thought then my head be feeling clearer
I traveled 70 states
Thought moving 'round make me feel better
I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away (don't you cry, baby)
Away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
But it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds

Why Don't We Fall in Love
So many things I'm goin' through
So much that I wanna do
It startin' to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really what it seems
So many days I've thought of you

Why don't we (so why don't we), don't we

Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (why don't we fall in love)
(It's so many reason)
(It's the only thing that matters to me)
Why don't we fall in love
It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one I never want to go
Think I never did know what to do
A love I never felt, now I feel with you
Why don't I just swallow each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend
Why don't we, don't we (why can't we)
Why don't we (why can't we), why don't we (why can't we)

Be Your Girl
Don't know if you got a girl
Don't mean to disrespect but
Thoughts of you rule my world
I even dream of you, I swear
Visions of you and I
See you all around my way
Been meaning to say hi but
I'm just way too shy
I gotta make you see this is
More than just a silly crush
wonder if you even notice me and
(Oh) you gotta feel me
(And I) would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)
All alone at night
I harbor feelings for you
Holding my pillow tight
Sometimes I even touch myself
Imagining your pleasure, baby
Next time I see you I'm
Gonna walk right up to you and
Say what's on my mind
I gotta make you see, this is
(More) than just a silly crush
wonder if you even notice me and
(Oh) you gotta feel me
(And I) would love you good

Ooh, you gotta feel me

(And I) I would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl) wanna be your girl

Gonna Love Me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
We do things in between the lines
We should do more to stand out
I'm sorry if I made you feel less than who you are
A little insecure, oh, you's a shinin' star
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that you're all alone
Thinkin' 'bout what you're gon' do
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
Sometimes I don't think we really say enough
Why is it so hard to keep in touch?
When we're layin' right next to each other, baby
We shouldn't read into things so much
Overthinkin', understandin'
Don't let a feelin' change it up
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that I'm all alone
Thinkin' 'bout what I'm gon' do
I hope that I see it through, ooh, ooh, yeah

You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me

A Long Walk
You're here, I'm pleased
I really dig your company
Your style, your smile, your peace mentality
Lord, have mercy on me
I was blind, now I can see
What a king's supposed to be
Baby I feel free, come on and go with me
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18
Your background it ain't squeaky clean (shit)
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all are sinners
But you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner
I respect that, man you're so phat
And you're all that, plus supreme
Then you're humble man I'm numb
Yo with feeling, I can feel everything that you bring
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Revelation 3:17
Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday (Saturday)
Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze and listen to a symphony
Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent
Come on, Come on
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe baby, maybe we can save the nation
Come on, Come on

Emotional Rollercoaster
Last night I cried, tossed and turned
Woke up with dry eyes
My mind was racing, feet were pacing
Lord, help me, please tell me what I have gotten into
Ran my three miles to clear my mind
It always helps me out, it's my therapy
When I'm losing it which is usually
I'm on an emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
But I can't get off
This emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
Oh, I can't get off
Yesterday, I told myself I was gonna be okay
Gonna start a new day, be truly happy
I was gonna take control of me
But eventually reality hit me mentally, physically, emotionally
And I opened my eyes and realized
That I was still being taken for a constant ride on your
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
I can't get off
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
I can't get off
So tired of you making love to me
Then disappearing so suddenly
Up and down it goes
And I'm so tired of you pacifying me
With promises you know that you'll never keep
Round and round it goes
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off

Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
… Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then, why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't find
All the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

Long black heels bought by no man (woo-ooh)
Two jobs so she can try and bring him home
'Cause, girl, you know he tied up by the man (ooh-ooh)
Her love is the pinnacle of the world, it's heaven-sent
Oh, thought they could tell it, "Shut up, " it keeps spreadin'
It got all the people talkin' 'bout it, but who could do without
All the circles pointin' back to where we started? (started)
Waitin' in the storm (ooh-ooh)
Underneath the cherry forest
Time brings changes in the story
Find your way back to your glory (oh, ooh-ooh oh)

They wanna worry your pretty lil' skin (woo ooh-oh)
Hold your soul in a world oh, so cold (ooh)

Our love is the pinnacle of the world, it's heaven-sent
All the circles pointin' back to where we started
Waitin' in the storm (waitin' in the storm)

Cherry drops keep fallin' just to bloom in springtime (bloom in springtime)

And the cherry fallin' symbolizes new beginnings
Things that are of old ending

Watch how you're spendin' your time
Show how you're spendin' your love

And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away

The running's fast
Run run run run
You're beautiful to me
Run run run run you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, in my world
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archer's bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Keep em high y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me
Beautiful

Burn
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you

Hope you find peace for yourself
New boyfriend ain't gon' fill the void

Soul Sista

Words just disguise all the things that you need

Hearts filled righteously
Whatever it is, I know that it's real

Charlene
Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
To hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold
She must have told me a thousand times before
Silent cries I use to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things
But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
Promise I can't live without her
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone
I pray that she'll come back one day
In my life
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
Oh oh oh
Sometimes I cry
Charlene if you're listening would you call on me
Because my heart is aching

Find a Way
It used to be, we would be the best of all friends
It turned to be L O V E and I was your man
So you was my lady-friend, we spent time
I found a way to be by your side
Through the ins and outs, the wrongs and rights
After a while of bein' settled down, I didn't know how to keep the love
'cause I was young, I wish I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't let you go, I swear I would've made this love grow
I spent a lot of time and a lot of dough
Tryin' to match what we had and now I, I
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
Wish that I would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know until you left, I loved your smile
Just the other day your girl said that you can't stand me
I know you don't mean that
Can't we just slow down a minute and talk it out?
I've been through my share of love since then
Don't know about what you've been through
But nothin' compares to what we had
All I know is I need you back and I know that you need me back
Baby, let's try again to find our love
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
I can't forget the times we shared
Didn't know love until love was gone
'Til I moved on
Now I'm right back to square one again
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love
Find our love, baby
Find our love, baby

Quiet part of my life

Everybody got somethin' to say

Still
It's been a long time since we last spoke
I still wonder what you're up to
After all the shit we've been through
And I've been spending a lot of time drinking and smoking
Hoping to subdue
The thought of you in my head
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questioning what is he doing
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
It still hurts
There's been a lot of nights when I feel alone
Needed someone to talk to
'Cause I just need to get through
And I've been spending a lot of money
On things that I don't need
Hoping that I'll feel new
But I can't get you out my head
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questioning what is he doing
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain (girl, I've been trying to find a way)
Since you've been away (a way that I can numb this pain)
I don't wanna feel anymore (I don't wanna feel)
And there's probably people telling you
That I'm doing fine (I'm just tryna get you outta my head)
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
It still hurts

Killing Me
You
You
Why, do I depend on you?
6 then I'm 'bout to pull up
Think 'bout your body too much
I'm feeling you for real
Missin' the party for what?
There ain't nobody but us
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through (uh)
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right you're killing me
That's right you're killing me
Adrenaline gentlemen, baby
Skeletons that I don't hold back
Try to stop, do you feel relaxed?
Love it when you make me feel like that
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through (uh)
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, you're killing me
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, you're killing me
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right, that's right (ooh, ooh-ooh)
That's right, that's right, that's right (ooh, ooh-woah)
That's right, that's right, that's right

Ain't that a shame? (I know it's a shame)
I've been good
For some time
I'd be lyin' if I said that
You ain't on my mind
Been tryna give it some time
Feelin' like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say
I can say that lovin' you is easy
I don't need to prove a single thing
Somewhere along the way I guess you got under my skin
I put all my cards out on the table
You ain't ever gonna show your hand
I would rather hold you close than try to understand
Mornin' sun, mornin' high
Oh, I think this haze is for now my best disguise
No need to think about why
What'cha say, starry-eyed
How you love to smile
And watch the clouds reside
Just tryna give it some time
Feelin' like I'm runnin' away
Never had the chance, chance to say

Clouded

Gotta get it how you live, you know?
Everybody talkin' 'bout R&B shit
I'm just talkin' me shit
You know what I mean?
Let me hear that
I gave it all for a fantasy
Is anybody gon' remember me?
If I go tonight, I doubt the world'll change
I just pray they don't forget my name
These are game rules, I can't lose
When it's all said and done, will I still be cool?
Spent like (how much?)
Ten thousand (ten thousand)
Twenty thousand (twenty thousand)
Thirty thousand (thirty thousand)
Forty thousand (forty thousand)
How much I'ma spend profilin'?
She come in and compliment my closet
Fuck her on the floor like I don't give a fuck 'bout it
Your judgement get clouded when you clouted
My opposition wish I'd stop smilin'
My family wish I'd stop wildin'
I'm still on the east side smokin' with my OG's
'Cause they the only ones that really know me
I was fuckin' superstars when I was nineteen (hmm)
The shit we did, you won't believe me
Now I'm at the turn up, lookin' lonely
Then they wonder why I'm quiet at them house parties
'Cause everybody see me (see me)
Roll some blunts and hit her once and now she need me (need me)
Her nigga wanna be me (yeah)
But they don't know I'm fightin' demons
I feel like dyin' every season
I've been swimmin' in the deep end
All my bitches know I'm leavin' at some point (mm, I'm out)
Whether there's a reason or not
Don't try givin' me reasons to stop

Easily
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
We had a good thing going lately
Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know
That they ain't real
I'll take the truth over the story
You might've tried my patience lately
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do something for me?
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Coming and going
Inside out
Back to front
All tangled and messy
That's how we've been and we'll always be
And that's alright with me
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

69 Camaro
'69 Camaro, put it into drive
Got it painted red and white
Still seeing blue and reds
Swear they want a nigga dead
These people with the cameras ain't no friend of mine, no
Never smile in my photos
Penthouse view downtown
Owed up, what that bank look like?
Extended all my credit lines
Hear a lot of noise coming out your mouth
I get wilted roses from the crowd
Bet you bought a ticket just so you could say you
Saw it when the shit went down
Where that nigga at now?
Now you got your wishes, had to sell the whiz kid
People say I'm falling
Used to be the man, now the man's down (man's down)
How did I get so caught up?
Why even try? Try to defy?
I'm the type to press my luck
Why fall in line? I don't care no more, no more
Feel a little woozy, can't stand now (oh)
Everybody's smiling, got their hands outside
Don't know how to keep dry
Hear a lot of noise coming out your mouth
(Coming out your mouth, baby)
They throw wilted roses from the crowd
And I'm sure you bought yourself a ticket just so you could say you
Saw it when the shit went down
Where that nigga at now?
Well you got your wishes, I lost my position
People say I'm falling (people say I'm falling)
Used to be the man, now the man's down
(The man's down, yeah, the man's down) man's down (ah)
Ooh, whoa, nah-nah (ah)
Ooh, you only hit me up
When shit is going down, down, down (going down, down, down)
Why they don't want me around? (Ah)
Down, down

Silence
Silence
Silence could be the best conversation
Cause baby, I've been thinking so much about that lately
My lady, I'm on my knees
Can you please, tell me where I need to be
Cause I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you (ooh yeah)
I'm lost, I'm lost without you
(Ooh yeah)
Inner peace
You should come and show me what it means to ya
Possession
A livelihood of you keeping all you need for ya
My lady, I care for you so loosely
So show me where I need to be
Cause I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you (ooh yeah)
I'm lost, I'm lost without you
(Ooh yeah)
It's love, love, love (mhmm)
Oh it's love, love, love (oh yeah)
It's love, love, love (mhmm)
Oh It's love, love, love (oh yeah)
Lost without you (ooh yeah)

It's love, love, love

Miss Summer
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time, living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Every night, I recall this same love (on and on again)
Although my dreams are all she's made of (on and on again)
Like a truce to be made
There's two sides to the pain
Pray I choose right anyway
Wired to chasе love
Wipe my tears in thе face of death
No need for a chaser
Hoping the moment don't fade 'til I'm high again
Focus on mine, keep faith, and we'll fly again
Love, at least I can when you're right here
I know the feeling might change when the night ends
Unless the world stops for you, but
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on again
