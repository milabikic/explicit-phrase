Early Morning Breeze
I open up my door to greet the early morning sun
Closing it behind me and away I do run
To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees
To have a word with God in the early morning breeze
A rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze

You're Supposed To Be Feeling Good
Soulmate, I see you down there
Waiting for morning to softly be coming
I find I'm only in deeper and you'd be a leaver
If you weren't so scared
Your true love has made you feel better
But look out for later when she makes you feel worse
Times change in daydreams and flashes
A taste of the past is all I have seen
But you're supposed to be feeling good now
'Cause everybody said you would
Honey, does it blow your mind that the prophets would lie?
Well, you're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Feeling like you're down and out over someone like me
Soulmate, the blues are deceiving
It keeps us believing we're on the wrong road
One side is just like the other
Except for the color and size of the load
And just how much it shows
But you're supposed to be feeling good now
'Cause everybody said you would
Oh honey, does it blow your mind that the prophets would lie?
You're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Just feeling like you're down and out over someone like me

Secretary 
It's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
Girls, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
She takes the time to listen
To what he has to say
While all you do is nag him
A thousand times a day
Her hair is always pretty
And her clothes are always stylish
But you greet him with your hair in rollers
And that's outdated and so childish
Oh, it's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
We make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
Are you there when he needs you?
Are your favors less than cute?
And when he tries to love you
Do you find something else to do?
Now the ordinary girl may not wear pearls
Or diamonds on each hand
Oh, but like the secretary, wooh
She knows how to please her man
Oh, it's not extraordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
You see, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life, hey, hey
You see, life's a bowl of cherries
For all the secretaries, hey, hey
Oh, it's very ordinary, it's not extraordinary
Girls, don't be contrary or you'll make it necessary
Your life can be so merry just like the secretary
Life's a bowl of cherries

Now's the time for all good men
To get together with one another
We got to iron out our problems
And iron out our quarrels
And try to live as brothers
And try to find a piece of land
Without stepping on one another
And do respect the women of the world
Remember you all have mothers
We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give
I know we can make it
I know darn well we can work it out
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?

You're so rare, man, you're so fine
You know, I'm so glad you're mine
You're so very rare and so fine

You make my, my moan turn to whisper
You make my whisper turn to call
You make me scream and scream that I love you
When you, when you make me rise and fall
You're so rare, and you're so fine
And I'm so very, very, very glad you're mine
You're so rare and so fine

To see it, to see it all come true
'Cause you're so rare, and you're, you're so fine
And Lord knows, I'm so very glad you're mine
You're so rare, so rare, and you're so very, very fine
Oh, you cleared all the questions from my mind
We come a, we come a long, long way together, baby
Through the hard times and all the good
I'm gonna take this day to celebrate you, baby
'Cause I have to stop and praise you like I should
You're so rare, take yo' praise, and you're so fine
And I hope you know I'm glad you're mine
Take yo' praise, you're so rare, take yo' praise, you're so fine
Take yo' praise, I'm glad you're mine

Somebody’s Watching You 
Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture
Witty, witty, witty as you can be
Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free
Ever stop to think about a downfall?
Happens at the end of every line
Just when you think you've pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Games are to be played with toys, et cetera
Love is to be made when you'rе for real
Ups and downs are caused by lifе in general
Some are yours no matter how you feel
Shady as a lady in a moustache
Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon
The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you

Killing Me Softly with His Song 
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
To listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
La la la, la la la
Ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh
La ahh ahhhhhh haaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ha ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh ahh
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me (softly)
He was strumming my pain
Yeah, he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

othing from Nothing 
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
You gotta have something if you wanna be with me
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
You gotta have something if you wanna be with me
I'm not trying to be your hero
'Cause that zero is too cold for me
I'm not trying to be your highness
'Cause that minus is too low to see, yeah
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
And I'm not stuffing, believe you me
Don't you remember I told ya
I'm a soldier in the war on poverty
Yeah, yes, I am
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
You gotta have something if you wanna be with me
Nothing from nothing leaves nothing
You gotta have something if you wanna be with me
That's right, ha, yeah
Gotta have something if you wanna be with me
You gotta bring me something, girl, if you wanna be with 

Superfly 
Darkest of night with the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong; lotta things goin' on
The man of the hour has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Hard to understand what a hell of a man
This cat of the slum had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own but the man lived alone
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
The game he plays, he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' to get over
That's what he tryin' to do, y'all
Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Woo, Super Fly, huh, huh
The aim of his role was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream: what does it mean? He wouldn't know
"Can't be like the rest" is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out and there's no happiness
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Super Fly
Super Fly
Super Fly
Super Fly
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over

Theme from Shaft 
Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
(Shaft)
Ya damn right
Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?
(Shaft)
Can you dig it?
Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?
(Shaft)
Right on
They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother...
(Shut your mouth)
I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft
(Then we can dig it)
He's a complicated man
But no one understands him but his woman
(John Shaft)

War 
(War, huh) Yeah!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, uhuh
(War, huh) Yeah!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Say it again, y'all!
(War, huh) Lookout!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me, awwwww!
War I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives
I said
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it again
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me!
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, awwww
War is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest, within the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
Awwww!
(War, huh) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) Oh-ohh yeah, huh
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), It's got one friend, that's the undertaker, awwww
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days
War can't give life, it can only take it away, awwww!
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Oh, absolutely nothing
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, woooo!
Peace, love and understanding
Tell me, is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows there's gotta be a better way, ooohhh
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) You tell me, say it, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Stand up and shout it (Nothing)

Got to Give It Up 
I used to go out to parties
And stand around

No more standin' there beside the walls

Ball of Confusion (That’s What the World Is Today) 
One, two
One, two, three, four, ow!
People movin' out, people movin' in
Why? Because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on
Well, the only person talkin' 'bout "Love thy brother"
Is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learnin'
But the teacher
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration Aggravation, humiliation, obligation to our nation
Ball of confusion
Oh, yeah
That's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey
The sale of pills are at an all-time high
Young folks walkin' 'round with their heads in the sky
Cities aflame in the summertime
And oh, the beat goes on
Evolution, revolution, gun control, the sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon, kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on
So 'round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, said, nobody knows
Oh, Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
Just a ball of confusion
Oh yeah, that's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey
Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand, population out of hand
Suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war"
And the band played on
Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
It's a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey
Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya
Sayin', ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey (Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya)

And call the law
Cut off the lights
And call the law
Standing over there
The devil's Son In Law
Call the law
Call the law
The devil's son-in-law
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Bring on the juice
Make me sweat
Still good
It's still good
Still good
It's still good
Turn over
Turn over
Soulful rover
Turn over
Turn over
Turn over
Take me in the change
Take me in the change
Take me in the change
Honky-tonk women
Is all I need
Honky-tonk women
Is what I want
Fellas, one more time
I wanna give the drummer
Some of this funky soul we got here
You don't have to do no solo-ing, brother
Just keep what you got
Don't turn it loose
'Cause it's a mother
When I count to four
I want everybody to lay off
Let the drummer go
When I count to four
I want you to come back in
I got to holler
I said, it's in my feet
Feels so sweet
It's in my shake, good God
About to work me to death
It's in my shirt
About to work me to death
It's in my shirt
I'm about to blow
I'm about to blow
One, two, three, four
Get it
Ain't it funky
Ain't it funky
Ain't it funky
Ain't it funky
One, two, three, four
The name of this tune is 'The Funky Drummer'
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer
The funky drummer

It’s Just Begun 
Watch me now
Feel the groove
Into something
Gonna make you move
Here we come
On the run
Don't know what
We're running from
Day or night
Black or white
Dance or sing
You gotta do your thing
You gotta do your thing
Peace will come
This world will rest
Once we have
Togetherness
Day or night
Dynomite
We had fun
But it's just begun
It's just begun
It's just begun
It's just begun (x 30)

Lovely Day 
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

Detroit Rock City 
...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...
"..Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day..."
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio, it goes
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why?
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Get up

Wish You Were Here 
And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes, now which is it?
I am sure of it
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

Everlong 
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head, she sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when

Carry On Wayward Son 
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more, no
Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
But surely heaven waits for you
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry, don't you cry no more
No more

See who's hanging out
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip
A slip of the hip or another, I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna trick ya, I'll trick ya
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna trick ya, trick ya, trick ya, trick ya
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip
I'll walk down the mall, stand over by the wall
Where I can see it all, find out who you call
Lead you to the supermarket checkout
Some specials and rat food, get lost in the crowd
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna get ya

I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna get ya

Because the Night 
Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust

When Will I Be Loved 
I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
Tell me, when will I be loved?
