PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA
Boy, I know you can't help but to be yourself 'round me
Yourself 'round me, now
And I know nobody's perfect, so I'll let you be, I'll let you be
It's the way you wear your emotions on both of your sleeves, ah-ah-ah
To the face you make when I tell you that I have to leave, ooh-ooh
But I like it, baby, ooh, I like it, baby
But I like it, baby, baby, but I like it, baby
Ah, we don't need the world's acceptance
They're too hard on me, they're too hard on you, boy
I'll always be your secret weapon in your arsenal, your arsenal
And I know you had it rough growing up, but that's okay (that's okay)
I like it rough (that's okay, baby)
Even when you let your feelings get in the way (let your feelings get in the way)
I still like it, baby, ooh, I like it, baby (like it, baby)
But I like it, baby (like it, baby)
Baby, baby (like it, baby)
I still like it, baby, baby, baby, baby
Say, say you won't change
I love the little things that make you, you
Ooh, the rest of the world is strange
Stay in our lane, just you and me, and our family
I think you're so cool (even though I'm cooler than you)
Boy, I love that you can't help but be yourself around me
Yourself around me
Sugar, well you're trippin', I know we'll make up and make love
So I'll let you be, I'll let you be
It's the way you listen when I'm cryin'
You let me lean in
It's the way you want one more kiss after you said you were leavin'
But I like it, baby (yes, I like it, baby, yes, I like it baby)
Yes, I like it, baby (like it, baby)
Like it, I like it, I love it, baby
I like it, baby
I like it, I love it, baby
I like it, baby (I like it, ooh, like it, I like it, yeah)
I like, like it, baby
I like it, baby
Oh, I like it, baby
Baby, come on over (ooh, I like it, baby)
And I need you, baby
Baby (na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na)

Anything
Maybe I should kill my inhibition
Maybe I'll be perfect in a new dimension
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson, ooh
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do-do-do, down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will
Keeping up is hard to do
Even harder feeling heavy, steady chasing you
Beep beep, why are you looking around, you lonely?
I feel you coming down like honey
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson, ooh
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do-do-do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do you know I'm alive?
Do you even know?

It's safe to say that we might even be falling in love

Small Reminders
Time is racing (yeah, yeah)
Life seems so long (so long, hey, uh)
Don't go wasting
Before it's all gone
Never stop, never quit, never that (never that)
Promises that I make to myself (yeah)
Big drip so I stay in my bag (big drip)
Bad bitch, make a hater so mad (woo)
Lookin' up, there's snakes in the grass
Don't mix, so I stay on my own
When I get to the top it's a wrap
Ain't nobody tellin' me shit about shit
And that's that
Now or never
Perfect timing
I'll live forever
The stars keep shining
Love will find us
Don't go chasing
Small reminders
Time is racing
I spend fifty-five on the fill-up
Fill-up
I got the top down in the winter
Winter, it's windy
I keep the cookies and the doobie lit up
Lit up, uh
I'm dodgin' police, gotta duck tonight
Tonight
And I'm hella fly, push it up, feelin' soft
Wonderful, rolling up the weed and
I live it up, goin' through the ceilin' now
Came back, do a three-peat, Michael Jordan
Uh, I got the dream and I see it clearer
Before my head ever hit the pillow
I paid my dues and I feel like enough is enough
And enough is enough, and enough is enough, and enough is enough
Goin' so dumb
Goin' crazy
Losing count of
Blunts, still fancy
They say nothing lasts forever
Be in pain or be in pleasure
Nothing hurts me anymore unless I let it
We're the lucky ones
What do you dream about
When no one else is there to listen?
What do you wish for?
What do you care about?
Got so much weight all on your shoulders
You secretly carry around
You look in the mirror
When you think about your mistakes
Don't make a sound
Who are you really though?
When no one can convince you different
Do you even know?
If you could undo what you're going through
Would you?
Ooh, you and me


Shooter Interlude
And I'm keeping all this part too
Can I borrow some money?
Can you call me an Uber?
My mama needs surgery
And my son needs a scooter
Can you start up my start-up?
Can you move my maneuver?
I think you need Jesus
I think you need a shooter
So who you been fuckin'? Who you been foolin'?
How many bottles you got in your mini cooler?
S on your chest, but you never feel super
Do you ever feel stupid? Do you call out for Cupid?
Can I borrow your chains? Can I have your last name?
Can I come over later? And can I overstay my welcome?
Downplay the help, but don't say I ever
Borrowed your paper, don't forget the favors I did for you
Before you blew up
Knew you before you grew up
I used to babysit you, dated your baby sister
I wanted babies with you
Your daughter's supposed to be mine
Shouldn't have wasted your time
Put a ring on your finger
'Cause you've been dating lames
And all those famous names
Playin' those famous games
So can I borrow some money?
Call me an Uber
My mama needs surgery
And my son needs a scooter
Start up my start-up
Move my maneuver
I think you need Jesus
Think you need a shooter
Think you need a
Think you need a shooter
I think you need Jesus, huh
Think you need a shooter
I think you need

That's What I'm Here For

You should know by now how I feel
That my love is real
Feels secure knowing
You've got my heart in away
I can never stray
But now people talk
They say our love won't last (love won't last)
They say my love for you
Soon it will (past)
But you should no for sure
I will never leave, you're all the man I need
I hope you see

To be the only one you dream of

All that I have
I want to be there for you will you be there for me, for me
(Verse)
I'll be here to give you what you need
You can count on me - baby
Feels secure knowing
You've got my heart in a way
I can never stray
But now people talk
They say our love won't last (love won't last)
They say my love for you
Soon it will (past)
But you should no for sure
I will never leave, you're all the man I need
You can believe

(Rap)
Ya so moist
Plus you got the platinum voice
And you fine smelling like 360 Divine
You blow my mind away
Tonight and forever like diamonds al right
We tight like that
Stress time for chillin'
Times is short good and part
Cause you know you're my dime
The top illin'
They jealous cause me you styles killin'
ain't nothin' happenin' with that breakdown talk
We can walk the walk and keep it real
Like New York I'm sold up, you word up uh
If we just show'em I'll blow'em twice
And we'll just keep flowin' like Chardone'
On ice as we lounge in the crib and parle'
You know what I mean
Not to mention your lover supreme
Move's truly with throughout the evening
I'm here no question as long as I'm peepin' Illtown
Repeat Chorus Until Fade......

I know I'm too pretty to not do nothing with it
So I'ma move to Atlanta

And I know that somewhere near
So where's my millionaire
I just wanna be taken care of
'Cause I worked enough, karma's over love
I just wanna lay back, spend my baby money in his Maybach
I deserve that life
Be a damn good housewife
Two kids from a surrogate
Fly mama, I'ma stay fit, gettin' facelifts
Soccer mom, gettin' wasted (Wasted)
Hermès tennis bracelet (Bracelet)
Bora Bora for vacation
I'll be anything but basic
On the other side
On the other side

My Mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
Pretendin' I have the patience
Pretendin' there is enough time for waitin'
Rememberin' when we kept it all basic
I wanna go back so that I could taste it
What do I care for?
You were not there anymore
I was not careful
That is all your fault
You let me fall
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
Buried alive here inside a nightmare
Livin' a life where you're gone
There is no light here
It'll be light-years until my mind's clear (you're gone)
I did it all for love
I did it all
I'd trade it all for you
I'd trade it all
But what do I care for?
What are you here for?
If you're not there when I call?
I was not careful
And that's all your fault
You let me fall
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (in my mine)
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
This ain't how it's supposed to be
You and me supposed to be
Remember when it be just you and me
In your crib smokin' trees
Like you took control of me
You had a hold of me
Had me so gone, baby
Yeah, you had me givin' me all of me
Now it's all over, it's all done
Shouldn't have never told ya, you're the one
I'll be all right
I will be just fine
I'll be okay
Once you get out my mind
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (in my mine)
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
In my mine
In my mine, mine
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sunset Eyes
Feels like our love's in eclipse
It's like it has a different you to it
The room, the mood
The moonlight was dim
I know you felt that, right?
That night, I couldn't describe
The feeling when I saw the sunset in your eyes
'Cause I, I knew something wasn't right
The sight of us was fallin'
That night, I couldn't describe
The moment when I realized that it was time for us
To say that somethin' isn't right
The thought of us has faded away
Feels like we're forcing this
Even your touch has different weight to it
You kiss my lips and I'm indifferent
I didn't feel that high
That night (that night), I couldn't describe
The feeling when I saw the sunset in your eyes
'Cause I, I knew that something wasn't right
The sight of us was fallin'
That night, I couldn't describe
The moment when I realized that it was time for us
To say that somethin' isn't right
The thought of us has faded away

One
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No need, it's too late (would I have to suffer?)
Goddamn, this pressure is having me feeling frustrated
And all this bad weather followin' me like we datin'
Tryna be what they dream, what they fantasize
And still be me, me, myself at the same fuckin' time
And man, it's never been like this, I'm feelin' so faded
And not in the good way that you get from drinkin' Jamie
Tryna see where life leads, what the future lies
Anxiety all on me, keepin' me up at night
It's already rough dealin' with this stuff
Don't know if I'll move up, am I good enough?
One step at a time (hello), yeah (hello)
I've got to lighten up, stop being so tough
But when I make it up the way I dreamed of
Will I ever find it? (Hello, hey), yeah, yeah, yeah
And I don't know if I'll ever succeed
I just want you proud of me up above
(What you seek, you will find when you look inside)
(All these things on your mind, just a waste of time)
One thing I promise, I'll make you happy
Don't forget that I will never give up
Shit, it's been a week, only felt like a one day
Tryin' to get some sleep, time itself keeps on warpin'
You and me just ain't working right
Just like that, what a thing is to realize
Never call 'em back, pretty whack, that's my forté
Tryna get the stack, platinum racks, but the right way
All my love workin' overtime
And for what? Just to feel like I done missed my prime
It's already rough dealin' with this stuff
Don't know if I'll move up, am I good enough?
One step at a time, yeah (one step at a time, whoa)
I've got to lighten up, stop being so tough
But will I make it up the way I dreamed of?
Will I ever find it? (Will I ever find it?)
And I don't know if I'll ever succeed

Cranes in the Sky
I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair
I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder
I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away, away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Well, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
I tried to run it away
Thought then my head be feeling clearer
I traveled 70 states
Thought moving 'round make me feel better
I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away (don't you cry, baby)
Away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
But it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds

Why Don't We Fall in Love
So many things I'm goin' through
So much that I wanna do
It startin' to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really what it seems
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly, you and I
We fall in love, so many reasons why
Why don't we (so why don't we), don't we
Why don't we, why don't we (yeah)
Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (why don't we fall in love)
(It's so many reason)
(It's the only thing that matters to me)
Why don't we fall in love
It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one I never want to go
Think I never did know what to do
A love I never felt, now I feel with you
Why don't I just swallow each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend
Why don't we, don't we (why can't we)
Why don't we (why can't we), why don't we (why can't we)
Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (we, can't we fall)

Be Your Girl
Don't know if you got a girl
Don't mean to disrespect but
Thoughts of you rule my world
I even dream of you, I swear
Visions of you and I
See you all around my way
Been meaning to say hi but
I'm just way too shy
I gotta make you see this is
More than just a silly crush
wonder if you even notice me and
(Oh) you gotta feel me
(And I) would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)
All alone at night
I harbor feelings for you
Holding my pillow tight
Sometimes I even touch myself
Imagining your pleasure, baby
Next time I see you I'm
Gonna walk right up to you and
Say what's on my mind
I gotta make you see, this is
(More) than just a silly crush
wonder if you even notice me and
(Oh) you gotta feel me
(And I) would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl) just wanna be your girl
I wonder if you even notice me
Ooh, you gotta feel me
I would love you good
(Just wanna be, just wanna be)
(Just wanna be) your girl
wonder if you even notice me and
(Oh) you gotta feel me
(And I) would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)
I wonder, I wonder

(And I) I would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl) wanna be your girl

Gonna Love Me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
We do things in between the lines
We should do more to stand out
I'm sorry if I made you feel less than who you are
A little insecure, oh, you's a shinin' star
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that you're all alone
Thinkin' 'bout what you're gon' do
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
Sometimes I don't think we really say enough
Why is it so hard to keep in touch?
When we're layin' right next to each other, baby
We shouldn't read into things so much
Overthinkin', understandin'
Don't let a feelin' change it up
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that I'm all alone
Thinkin' 'bout what I'm gon' do
I hope that I see it through, ooh, ooh, yeah
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me

A Long Walk
You're here, I'm pleased
I really dig your company
Your style, your smile, your peace mentality
Lord, have mercy on me
I was blind, now I can see
What a king's supposed to be
Baby I feel free, come on and go with me
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18
Your background it ain't squeaky clean (shit)
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all are sinners
But you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner
I respect that, man you're so phat
And you're all that, plus supreme
Then you're humble man I'm numb
Yo with feeling, I can feel everything that you bring
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Revelation 3:17
Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday (Saturday)
Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze and listen to a symphony
Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent
Come on, Come on
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe baby, maybe we can save the nation
Come on, Come on

Emotional Rollercoaster
Last night I cried, tossed and turned
Woke up with dry eyes
My mind was racing, feet were pacing
Lord, help me, please tell me what I have gotten into
Ran my three miles to clear my mind
It always helps me out, it's my therapy
When I'm losing it which is usually
I'm on an emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
But I can't get off
This emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me, for me
Oh, I can't get off
Yesterday, I told myself I was gonna be okay
Gonna start a new day, be truly happy
I was gonna take control of me
But eventually reality hit me mentally, physically, emotionally
And I opened my eyes and realized
That I was still being taken for a constant ride on your
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
I can't get off
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
I can't get off
So tired of you making love to me
Then disappearing so suddenly
Up and down it goes
And I'm so tired of you pacifying me
With promises you know that you'll never keep
Round and round it goes
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off
Emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off

I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me
… Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then, why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't find
All the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out
… What you thinkin'?
Stop blamin' me
