Kids in the Dark

The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa (The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
Whoa, whoa
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

Shots
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space?
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here
But I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishin' I had
What I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole (Oh, let me make it up to you)
Through every single thing that I loved
(Let me make it up to you)
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away (Let me make it up to you)
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Hey Hey
You've got to listen the guitars
Yes i can feel it in my blood
The taste of old good rock n roll
The alcohol
You got to lose your boring side
Let out your devil stay alive
Just try to prove this tasty sin
And let me in
Hey hey
The motherfuckers want to turn it off
Hey hey
But there is nothing to make us stop
Hey hey
Turn loud the music baby
And i will bring this down
You got to lose your own control
Just come with me in ecstasy
Feel the vibration in your bones
Don’t be strong as stone
You got to kiss my flaming soul
Forget your proud take off your clothes
Just keep on dancing to the beat
Scream, baby, scream 

Mayhem 
He said he didn’t even hear trains let alone the few words
The ladies maybe sayin’ about him
She freaks and tells her closest friend that she’ll never love again
But she’ll never, no not ever
Live without him
Wouldn’t believe it, if you seen it
Oh, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta Mayhem, woh oh oh yeah
She said he didn’t mean a thing so she threw her diamond ring
Out the window of a black cab in Camden
He couldn’t take it, what she did
So he threw a hissy fit and he took it out on anyone at random
Wouldn’t believe it, if you seen it
Oh, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta Mayhem, woh oh oh yeah
Dinning sound, lights spinning round, some mothers’ son
Gotta fight or got to run run run run
Run run run run run
Ten pints and then he starts a fight and he lands himself a night
In a cell wearing grey pants and bruises
Twelve mates bangin’ on the door, oh the back up vans galore
Never saw such a street full of losers

Stay High 
I already feel like doing it again, honey
'Cause once you know, then you know
And you don't wanna go
Back to wherever it is that you come from, yeah
I just want to stay high with you
'Cause where I come from
Everybody frowns and walks around
With that ugly thing on their face
And where I come from
We work hard and grind and hustle all day
(Yes, we do)
There comes a time, there comes a time
At night where we get to play
And we smile and laugh and jump and clap
And yell and holler and just feel great
I just want to stay high with you
With you, with you, baby
So don't question my state of mind
I'm doing wonderful, just fine, thank you
(Thank you)
Everything is everything and everything is beautiful
(How did you get like that?)
See, all I do is keep it cool and don't worry 'bout what everyone is doing
I already feel like doing it again, honey
I just want to stay high
I just want to stay high
I just want to stay high with you

Still into You 
Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time, I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)
I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you

Are you willing to sacrifice your life?
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble

Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style

Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus

Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it

Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster

Judging from my vibe, you can feel it in my energy
Stacking paper steadily so I can live in luxury
Looking in the mirror, I thank God for what I'm about to be

So I take my time, 'cause I'm always where I'm suppose to be

Thank you Mr. Ronson, for bringing us together this evening
We gon' go ahead, and head over to the after party
We'll see y'all uptown
Come on

I won’t play your game (no more) 
I've been waiting all my life to get you boy
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Now I got you, you don't care for me
Now I got you, you don't care for me
Here I am, wasting time
I fool myself thinking I do it right
So, ok! It's enough
Don't wanna play your game no more
(I won't play your game no more)
I´m not gonna beg you to treat me carefully
'Cause it's too late to stay with me
I´m not gonna beg you to treat me tenderly
If you don't know what love is
Don't wanna wake up tomorrow morning and find out that there's nobody there
But don't wanna sleep with a man who is sharing a bed with somebody else
Oh! Here I am, wasting time
I fool myself thinking I do it right
So, ok! It's enough
Don't wanna play your game no more
You can call me night and day but, believe me, there will be no replay
When you need me, forget it
If you miss me, forget about it
If you wanna cry, ok! That's not my fault
It's your turn to feel like a fool
Remember that we played by your rules
Now the game is not so funny, right?
I got to say, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
(I won't play your game no more)

Take You Higher 
I feel like a million bucks, babe, and so should you
I know I could fill you up, babe, if you want me to
I'll give you my body, baby, not just my mind
Don't act like it's complicated, we'll be just fine
I can take you a little bit higher
I can be your one desire
Boy, I'm on to you
I can take you a litte bit higher
I can be your one desire
If you want me to
You think that you're out of luck, babe, you're feeling down (so down)
My shock will be enough babe to turn your fortunes around
(give you my body) Said I'll give you my body (ooh), baby, not just my mind (ooh)
Don't act like its complicated, we'll be just fine
I've been waiting, anticipating for so long
I've been trying to make you feel
Trying to make you feel, trying to make you feel this way

If I Can't Have You
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room (Yeah)
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know, that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it

Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half
I want all of you, all the strings attached

Maniac
You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead so
You show up at my home all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause
People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated

Norman Fucking Rockwell

You're fun and you're wild

Stray
I wanna write a song
One that can explain my loss
I wanna write a song
That you can hear and
Know how my heart yearns
And how my insides churn
And how my cheeks burn
From the weekly storm
And how my face turns
Before you return to the wall
And then down the floor
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I will stray
I gotta write a song
But I wanna feel my words
And I keep getting it all wrong
Think it out, write it out, rip it out
Throw it all to the wall
And I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
But I keep only seeing rain
I'll keep saying no
But you'll find your way into my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I'll stray
Wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna feel the way I used to

Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch

The First One
I know I shouldn't say what I'm 'bout to say
'Cause it's never okay to go and bring your exes up
No matter what
My second and my third, I hate they got the worst of me
They don't deserve the way that I was treating them
I'd lead them on
When I knew what I was doing
I was stupid, I was ruined, I was healing
But the healing never happened
And I'm sorry that I did you wrong
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah
I just can't forget some of the words he said
The memories in my bed keep coming back again
Like daggers in my mind, yeah
They draw blood all night, yeah
Yeah, I know what I've been doing
Running through 'em just to try and catch a feeling
But the feeling never happened
And I'm sorry that I did you wrong
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
No, there ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
Promise that it kills
Every time you send
A picture from a place
You and I used to go
I hope you know
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work

Runaway
I was listening to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands, down
I had a dream I was seven
Climbing my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waiting, impatient, for me, down
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you
And for a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, down
And all this time I have been lying
Oh, lying in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
La di da!
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
But I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
I can't take it anymore 

Bad Guy
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along
With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy

I'm only good at being bad
Bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean
I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy 

Want You In My Room
When all the lights out (Hey), where you're going?
I keep a window, for you, it's always open
I'm like a lighthouse, I'm a reminder of where you're going
I'm in your head now, from every second now
Is your love growing?
Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)

On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby, don't you want me, too?
When no one loves you like they really mean it
I got you covered, under covers
Can you feel it?
Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)
(I want you in my room)
On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window

Baby, don't you want me, too?
Baby, don't you want me, too?
On the bed, on the floor
Slide on through my window
Baby, don't you want me, too?

Planning a run away young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We've got no choices left
The running's fast
Run run run run
You're beautiful to me
Run run run run you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, in my world
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archer's bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Keep em high y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me
Beautiful

CYANIDE
I love dominantly
You make me weak, make me thirsty for release
Gwan come compliment me
Dem become an enemy
Cop a flight to Paris, lowkey
'Cause lil' baby girl I'm tryna breathe
Please baby try to understand me
I am not a monster, I'm just a man with needs
I take flights, when I learn it's time to go
Tryna take time by crossing timing zones
Come press your lips 'pon me
LSD got me feelin' empathy
Warfare out to mind chemically
'Cause we suffer endlessly
Could be Kamikaze, only time will tell
Even though I'm godly, might end up in Hell

Let me fight for it, me achieve it, 'chieve it

Whatever jaw has binded, let no man enter in
Give me your love, it's unrequited
The thought of you gets me excited

Offer you all your favorite vices, girl I know you like it

Still
It's been a long time since we last spoke
I still wonder what you're up to
After all the shit we've been through
And I've been spending a lot of time drinking and smoking
Hoping to subdue
The thought of you in my head
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questioning what is he doing
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
It still hurts
There's been a lot of nights when I feel alone
Needed someone to talk to
'Cause I just need to get through
And I've been spending a lot of money
On things that I don't need
Hoping that I'll feel new
But I can't get you out my head
So if you're out there somewhere
And if you still even care
Possibly still questioning what is he doing
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain
Since you've been away
I don't wanna feel anymore
And there's probably people telling you that I'm doing fine
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
I've been tryna find a way to numb all this pain (girl, I've been trying to find a way)
Since you've been away (a way that I can numb this pain)
I don't wanna feel anymore (I don't wanna feel)
And there's probably people telling you
That I'm doing fine (I'm just tryna get you outta my head)
Just taking my time
Although it appears that I'm strong
It still hurts

Easily
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
We had a good thing going lately
Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know
That they ain't real
I'll take the truth over the story
You might've tried my patience lately
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do something for me?
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Coming and going
Inside out
Back to front
All tangled and messy
That's how we've been and we'll always be
And that's alright with me
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits
Call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

69 Camaro

Still seeing blue and reds
Swear they want a nigga dead
These people with the cameras ain't no friend of mine, no
Never smile in my photos
Penthouse view downtown
Owed up, what that bank look like?
Extended all my credit lines
Hear a lot of noise coming out your mouth
I get wilted roses from the crowd
Bet you bought a ticket just so you could say you
Saw it when the shit went down
Where that nigga at now?
Now you got your wishes, had to sell the whiz kid
People say I'm falling
Used to be the man, now the man's down (man's down)
How did I get so caught up?
Why even try? Try to defy?
I'm the type to press my luck
Why fall in line? I don't care no more, no more
Feel a little woozy, can't stand now (oh)
Everybody's smiling, got their hands outside
Don't know how to keep dry
Hear a lot of noise coming out your mouth
(Coming out your mouth, baby)
They throw wilted roses from the crowd
And I'm sure you bought yourself a ticket just so you could say you
Saw it when the shit went down
Where that nigga at now?

People say I'm falling (people say I'm falling)
Used to be the man, now the man's down
(The man's down, yeah, the man's down) man's down (ah)
Ooh, whoa, nah-nah (ah)
Ooh, you only hit me up
When shit is going down, down, down (going down, down, down)
Why they don't want me around? (Ah)
Down, down

Silence
Silence
Silence could be the best conversation
Cause baby, I've been thinking so much about that lately
My lady, I'm on my knees
Can you please, tell me where I need to be
Cause I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you (ooh yeah)
I'm lost, I'm lost without you
(Ooh yeah)
Inner peace
You should come and show me what it means to ya
Possession
A livelihood of you keeping all you need for ya
My lady, I care for you so loosely
So show me where I need to be
Cause I'm lost, I'm lost without you
I'm lost, I'm lost without you (ooh yeah)

Lost without you
Lost without you (ooh yeah)
It's love, love, love
Oh it's love, love, love

Anything
Maybe I should kill my inhibition
Maybe I'll be perfect in a new dimension
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson, ooh
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do-do-do, down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will
Keeping up is hard to do
Even harder feeling heavy, steady chasing you
Beep beep, why are you looking around, you lonely?
I feel you coming down like honey
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson, ooh
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do-do-do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do-do you even know I'm alive?
Do-do you even know I, I
Do you know I'm alive?
Do you even know?

My Mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
Pretendin' I have the patience
Pretendin' there is enough time for waitin'
Rememberin' when we kept it all basic
I wanna go back so that I could taste it
What do I care for?
You were not there anymore
I was not careful
That is all your fault
You let me fall
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
Buried alive here inside a nightmare
Livin' a life where you're gone
There is no light here
It'll be light-years until my mind's clear (you're gone)
I did it all for love
I did it all
I'd trade it all for you
I'd trade it all
But what do I care for?
What are you here for?
If you're not there when I call?
I was not careful
And that's all your fault
You let me fall
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (in my mine)
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
This ain't how it's supposed to be
You and me supposed to be
Remember when it be just you and me
In your crib smokin' trees
Like you took control of me
You had a hold of me
Had me so gone, baby
Yeah, you had me givin' me all of me
Now it's all over, it's all done
Shouldn't have never told ya, you're the one
I'll be all right
I will be just fine
I'll be okay
Once you get out my mind
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All of the time tried to forget you
Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine (in my mine)
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine
In my mine
In my mine, mine
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Cranes in the Sky
I tried to drink it away
I tried to put one in the air
I tried to dance it away
I tried to change it with my hair
I ran my credit card bill up
Thought a new dress make it better
I tried to work it away
But that just made me even sadder
I tried to keep myself busy
I ran around circles
Think I made myself dizzy
I slept it away, I sexed it away
I read it away
Away, away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Well, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
I tried to run it away
Thought then my head be feeling clearer
I traveled 70 states
Thought moving 'round make me feel better
I tried to let go my lover
Thought if I was alone then maybe I could recover
To write it away or cry it away (don't you cry, baby)
Away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
But it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Yeah, it's like cranes in the sky
Sometimes I don't wanna feel those metal clouds
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away, away

Gonna Love Me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
We do things in between the lines
We should do more to stand out
I'm sorry if I made you feel less than who you are
A little insecure, oh, you's a shinin' star
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that you're all alone
Thinkin' 'bout what you're gon' do
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
Sometimes I don't think we really say enough
Why is it so hard to keep in touch?
When we're layin' right next to each other, baby
We shouldn't read into things so much
Overthinkin', understandin'
Don't let a feelin' change it up
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that I'm all alone
Thinkin' 'bout what I'm gon' do
I hope that I see it through, ooh, ooh, yeah
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
And oh, you gonna love me, yeah
I know you wanna hold me and squeeze me
Are you gonna love and squeeze me?
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me
Are you gonna hold me
And squeeze me
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hold me
And squeeze me

When It Rains It Pours
Sunday morning, man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinkin' that her leavin'
Is the only logical reason
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Springsteen
To this day, when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut off jeans
Somewhere between that settin' sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
We were just gettin' started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh"
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you
I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
Still be a spark
And back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what would mama think
'Bout your name on my arms
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound, roll the beat of a drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear "Born in the USA"
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me
Do you think about 17?
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky?
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Oh, Springsteen

Barefoot Blue Jean Night
A full moon shinin' bright
Edge of the water, we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and an old guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught up in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Whoa-oh, never gonna grow up, ha
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night

Head Over Boots
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah
So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
Yeah, I'm here to pick you up
And I hope I don't let you down, no, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
You're the one I want, you're the one I need

Drunk On A Plane
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
Hmm, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim, hmm
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane

Anything Goes

Do I Make You Wanna
Baby what's on your mind?
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can get lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind?
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down
Play a little truth or dare now
Act just like you don't care now
Girl, when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Karaoke in the neon light
Go to Vegas, stay up all night
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little seven, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show?
Or maybe just stay low?
I gotta know now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?

Wagon Wheel
Headin' down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-gettin' me down
Lost my money playin' poker, so I had to leave town
But I ain't a-turnin' back to livin' that old life no more
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Yeah, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke
But he's a-headin' west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I died in Raleigh, at least I will die free
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Oh, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel (oh, I wanna feel)
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me

Girl Like You
Love how you close your eyes
When I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah, you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you

Hometown Girl
She grew up around here on that southwest side
Where the corn grows up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night
She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot where she came from
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl


Tennessee Whiskey
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey


Knockin’ Boots
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me across town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
Fishing in the dark needs Nitty Gritty

Small town nights need both ends burning
Shades need drawing, hearts need falling
Boots need knockin'
Knockin' boots

Speakers, Bleachers And Preachers
You had a blue jean jacket, a burned CD
Said you wanna go somewhere fast with me
I picked you up
Yeah, and we turned it up
You had a broke heart necklace
Post-game smile
J Town front page news for awhile
Then we broke up
But I still turned it up
Cheerleading skirts and backseats
Free throws and church marquees
Kingsley countdown radio
Wouldn't know nothing if it weren't for all those
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss
The faster the car, more money you burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Story of my youth
Speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growin' up to do
Kroger parkin' lot, battle scars
Black and Mild on the dash under the stars
If Daddy asks they ain't mine
82 degrees on the bank sign
And hey, hey, summer jams
Any Chesney song gonna make her dance
When the sun goes down, yeah
I'll think about her now
And all those
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss

Story of my youth
Speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growin' up to do
Subs from my system
Rattlin' my rearview
Used to listen with my cousin
I miss him, he's gone now
It was the national anthem
And a knee-down prayer we were actin'
Like we weren't just like every other small town
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss
The faster the car, more money you burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Story of my youth

The Way I Talk
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it, them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheering on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man, it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Yeah it's, Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now
Fighting words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact, I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know
I sound a little bit like my daddy
I don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk

Loud and Heavy
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Pistons pumping
Minds are racing
It's hard to sleep, man
When I'm shaking
Bad news surrounds me
It's always found me
Creeping up when things are good
Yeah, the dark days find a way
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
The camra captures
All the things that
Make us turn from
What we see
It's always moving
It don't stop rolling
I haven't slept in three damn days
Yeah, but who needs that anyway?
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Loud thunder heavy rain
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
A long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Loud thunder heavy rain
Loud thunder heavy rain


Plain to See Plainsman
I cut through the Rockies like some unholy blade
The icy depths of the Pacific I have bade
Forever I wander, forever I stray
The rustle of wheat fields starts callin' my name
Callin' my name
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home
Well the North-folk are dandy, they don't mind the cold
The South has filled up both my belly and soul
I know when I'm gray and I know when I'm old
These bones will cry out for the place they were born
Place they were born
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home
I've met beautiful women, a pleasure to see
Road-bitten bikers and barefoot hippies
Junkies and saints on my travels I greet
But far too few are homesick young plainsmen like me
Plainsmen like me
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home


I Love This Life
I love my boots broke in, I love my Camo hat
Don't mind a little paint on my jeans, yeah I roll like that
I love driving my truck across the railroad tracks
If you hit it too quick, it'll hit ya right back
I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on
How it shines like gold when the sun turned on
I love the sound of them wheels with my baby singing along
When "The Boys Of Summer" comes on
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rollin' through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
I Love that county line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she's been sipping that wine
I still get drunk on her every time
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through mind
Man, I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
I love that ragged old barn that my grandpa made
It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church, out on 109
It's where I hit my knees and thank the Lord for this life of mine
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life

Heaven
Mmm
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time

God's Country
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (yeah)
God's country
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country)
Yeah, I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country


Runnin’ Outta Moonlight
Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up, you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust that's my headlights, that's my truck
Come on baby, don't you keep me waitin'
I gotta go, I've got a reservation tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms
Whoa, girl every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa, this is one that we don't wanna miss, no
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
Girl I bet you thought I lost my mind
Outta the blue pulling into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear
Whoa, girl you never look better than you do right now
Whoa, oh heaven let your light shine down
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
Whoa, girl, every now and then you get a night like this,

Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
Hey baby don't it feel so right
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
All I wanna do is hold you tight come on, come on, come on we're runnin' outta moonlight
Whoa, yea we're runnin' outta moonlight, whoa

Burn Out
Watching cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts, how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
The smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done me wrong songs hit me so right
I'm so on fire for you it hurts, how
Fast as one cigarette can burn out
If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
It's a smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done me wrong songs hit me so right
I'm so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out

Don’t Call Me
If you get yourself in another one of your binds
Run for help, yell for someone, pray for a sign
Dial 911, light a roadside flare
Up and run, I don't care
Just don't, don't call me
If your truck breaks down, if it all falls apart
Leave it on the shoulder, just get out, take a walk
If your shoes hurt your feet, take 'em off
Probably do ya some good, hell, maybe a lot
Just don't, don't call me
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
If you wake up in jail and they let you use the phone
Even if mine's the only number you know
You gotta figure it out on your own
You used up your favours a long time ago
So don't, well don't call me
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
Oh no you don't!
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
Oh you don't call me
don't call me!
(Pick up a book and get self help) that's right, you don't call me!
(1800, go to hell, there's always been someone else) don't call me!
No, no, no (you can lean on your other ex)
(I know y'all still text) don't call me!
(Call your mom, she'll fix your mess) don't call me!
(Call your doctor!) You don't call me!
(Your lawyer if you can afford one) don't call me!
(Lose my number, don't call Brandi, and don't call me)
don't call me
(Your tattoo artist; somebody else can get this party started)

If you need space Take a trip Hijack you a ride on a rocket ship Hang out with the constellations Get yourself some isolation babe

I've Been Loving You Too Long
I've been loving you too long to stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me
I've been loving you, a little too long
I don't wanna stop now
With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, our affair grows old
I've been loving you much too long
To stop now
I've been loving you much too long
I don't wanna stop now
Oh, please don't make me stop now
Oh, please I can't stop now
I've been loving you too long

Merry Go 'Round
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday mornin', you best be there
In the front row like you're supposed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary quite contrary
We get bored, so we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
We think the first time's good enough
So, we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want, it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction
'Cause mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored, so, we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

Red Dress
Last night I ached and pleaded for candlelight and you
Walked the floor 'til midnight and cried ’til half past two
Then you come in with a flimsy grin and a flimsier excuse
With your shirt just reeking of cheap perfume and stale vermouth
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get me a new red dress and go out and paint the town
Get out on the dance floor, strut them curves around
And we’ll just see who thinks that I'm a ragged hand me down
Lately when you look at me, you been seeing a trinity
Your mama, the Irish washer woman and a whore from gay Paree
But I'm from Enid, Oklahoma and my name is not Marie
And I don't like the aroma of your third hand ecstasy
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get my new red dress and go out and paint the town
Hem line slit high on the thigh, lots of cleavage to bounce around
And we'll just see who thinks that I'm a ragged hand me down
I don’t like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I’m gonna get my new red dress and go out and paint the town
I just got one life to live and then I'm six feet under ground
And I don’t think I'm gonna live it as a ragged hand me down
You'll have to wash your own shirts now and hang 'em out on your line of balderdash
Take your hot stuff and your pickup truck down to First Street and pay cash
I ain’t the socket for your rocket, babe, I ain't your playtime clown
And I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get me a new red dress and go out and paint the town
Gonna find someone to love me and what's in that scarlet gown
Someone who knows there's a lot more in it than a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna find someone to love me and what's in that scarlet gown

Can't Stop The Feeling

I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (Ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
Ooh, it's somethin' magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushin' on (Rushin' on)
I don't need no reason, don't need control (Need control)
I fly so high, no ceilin', when I'm in my zone
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (Ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance (No, no, no)
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
I can't stop the feelin' (Woo)
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin' (Yeah)
So keep dancin', come on
Oh
Yeah, oh
I can't stop the
I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
(I can't stop the feelin')
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feelin')
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on (Oh)

All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance (Dance, dance, dance)

And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
(I can't stop the feelin')
Everybody sing
Got this feelin' in my body
(I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feelin' in my body (Oh, no)
(I can't stop the feelin')
Wanna see you move your body (No, no, no)
(I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feelin' in my body, come on
Break it down
Got this feelin' in my body (Uh)
I can't stop the feelin'
Got this feeling in my body, come on (Ooh)
