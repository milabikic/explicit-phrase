Secretary 

It's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
Girls, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
She takes the time to listen
To what he has to say
While all you do is nag him
A thousand times a day
Her hair is always pretty
And her clothes are always stylish
But you greet him with your hair in rollers
And that's outdated and so childish
Oh, it's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
We make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
Are you there when he needs you?
Are your favors less than cute?
And when he tries to love you
Do you find something else to do?
Now the ordinary girl may not wear pearls
Or diamonds on each hand
Oh, but like the secretary, wooh
She knows how to please her man
Oh, it's not extraordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
You see, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life, hey, hey
You see, life's a bowl of cherries
For all the secretaries, hey, hey
Oh, it's very ordinary, it's not extraordinary
Girls, don't be contrary or you'll make it necessary
Your life can be so merry just like the secretary
Life's a bowl of cherries

Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Loving you, somehow I feel cheated
I ask, is this the way to be treated?
You take what you want
Then you stroll out the door contented
Used me, abused me
Knocked down and walked all over me
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?

Used me, abused me
Knocked down and walked all over me

I've been waiting for a long, long time
Now I got you, you don't care for me
Now I got you, you don't care for me
Here I am, wasting time
I fool myself thinking I do it right
So, ok! It's enough
Don't wanna play your game no more
(I won't play your game no more)
I´m not gonna beg you to treat me carefully
'Cause it's too late to stay with me
I´m not gonna beg you to treat me tenderly
If you don't know what love is
Don't wanna wake up tomorrow morning and find out that there's nobody there
But don't wanna sleep with a man who is sharing a bed with somebody else
Oh! Here I am, wasting time
I fool myself thinking I do it right
So, ok! It's enough
Don't wanna play your game no more
You can call me night and day but, believe me, there will be no replay
When you need me, forget it
If you miss me, forget about it
If you wanna cry, ok! That's not my fault
It's your turn to feel like a fool
Remember that we played by your rules
Now the game is not so funny, right?
I got to say, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
(I won't play your game no more)

Take You Higher 

I feel like a million bucks, babe, and so should you
I know I could fill you up, babe, if you want me to
I'll give you my body, baby, not just my mind
Don't act like it's complicated, we'll be just fine
I can take you a little bit higher
I can be your one desire
Boy, I'm on to you
I can take you a litte bit higher
I can be your one desire
If you want me to
You think that you're out of luck, babe, you're feeling down (so down)
My shock will be enough babe to turn your fortunes around
(give you my body) Said I'll give you my body (ooh), baby, not just my mind (ooh)
Don't act like its complicated, we'll be just fine
I've been waiting, anticipating for so long
I've been trying to make you feel
Trying to make you feel, trying to make you feel this way

Yes We Can Can 

Now's the time for all good men
To get together with one another
We got to iron out our problems
And iron out our quarrels
And try to live as brothers
And try to find a piece of land
Without stepping on one another
And do respect the women of the world
Remember you all have mothers
We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give
I know we can make it
I know darn well we can work it out
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna get together we can work it out
And we gotta take care of all the children
The little children of the world
'Cause they're our strongest hope for the future
The little bitty boys and girls
We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give
I know we can make it
I know darn well we can work it out
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna, yes we can can

Am I The Same Girl 

Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Whom you hurt so
I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
The one you used to meet
Around the corner every day
We would meet and slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Whom you hurt so
I'm the one you hurt
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one who cried
I'm the one you used to meet
But you are pretending
You don't care
And the fire is still there
But we were no longer too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am

Don’t you care 

Don’t You Care?
I see my baby dancing out there with someone else
He is dancing out there
I just want to know boy
Please tell me so…
Baby, baby, tell me… Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
I want to so desperately to hold you baby so close to me
But the way you treat me
It’s so hard to bear…
Baby, baby, tell me… Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
You trying to drive me completely away
Forgetting the love we shared just yesterday
But the way you’re acting now
Doesn’t seem to fit somehow
For all I see or seem
It’s just a dream within a dream
I see my baby and he is filled with joy
And he see’s that I’m not filled with his joy
All I hear is laughter, laughter from out there
Baby, baby, tell me… Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
See you baby and you’re filled with joy
And you see me baby I’m not filled with joy
Well just tell me, don’t you care?
Yeah, don’t you care?
Baby, don’t you care?
Yeah, don’t you care?
I love you baby with all my heart and soul
I love you baby I just can’t let you go
Oh, Don’t You Care?
Oh, Don’t You Care?
Hey baby, tell me, Don’t You Care?
Oooh
I just want to know boy
Tell me, Don’t You Care
Yeah Don’t You Care
Oh Don’t You Care
Yes don’t you care

Take Yo’ Praise 

We've come a long, long way together
Through the hard times and the good
I have to celebrate you, baby
I have to praise you like I should
You're so rare, so fine
I'm so glad you're mine
You're so rare, so fine
I'm so glad you're mine
You make me glad I'm a woman
'Cause you're a feeling, thinking man
And anytime I know you're needing
I'm gonna please you every way I can
You're so rare, you're so fine
I'm so glad you're mine
You're so rare and so fine
You clear the questions from my mind
I was afraid to say I love you
Afraid to take, and too eager to give
You helped me deal with what I'm feeling
With why and how I want to live
You're so rare, man, you're so fine
You know, I'm so glad you're mine
You're so very rare and so fine
I'm sure glad you're mine
I have to praise you when you hold me
When you work your way around
Ain't a part of me leftover
That your sweet love ain't found
You make my, my moan turn to whisper
You make my whisper turn to call
You make me scream and scream that I love you
When you, when you make me rise and fall
You're so rare, and you're so fine
And I'm so very, very, very glad you're mine
You're so rare and so fine
Oh, oh, you're mine, you're mine
You know, you know I want the best for you, baby
And what you want, I want for you
And we can, we can work together, baby
To see it, to see it all come true
'Cause you're so rare, and you're, you're so fine
And Lord knows, I'm so very glad you're mine
You're so rare, so rare, and you're so very, very fine
Oh, you cleared all the questions from my mind
We come a, we come a long, long way together, baby
Through the hard times and all the good
I'm gonna take this day to celebrate you, baby
'Cause I have to stop and praise you like I should
You're so rare, take yo' praise, and you're so fine
And I hope you know I'm glad you're mine
Take yo' praise, you're so rare, take yo' praise, you're so fine
Take yo' praise, I'm glad you're mine

Mr. Big Stuff

Somebody’s Watching You 

Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture
Witty, witty, witty as you can be
Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free
Ever stop to think about a downfall?
Happens at the end of every line
Just when you think you've pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Games are to be played with toys, et cetera
Love is to be made when you'rе for real
Ups and downs are caused by lifе in general
Some are yours no matter how you feel
Shady as a lady in a moustache
Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon
The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you

Trouble with My Lover 

Sometimes I get lonesome
Sometime I get a little blue
He got me walking around in circles
And after that I don't know what to do
What good is a love
You can't have it when you want it
What good is a love
If you can't own it
Love can be so good
And love can be so cruel
Love can make you happy
Make you blow your cool
But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the little old dark
You know he fill me up with a kind of delight
Ooh, the man's all right
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble (trouble)
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble (trouble)
I feel so helpless
I can't help myself
I don't want to see him no no no no
With nobody else
In the restless hours
I sit home alone
I wished I believe oh yeah
This man I love
But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the little old dark
You know he fill me up with a kind of delight
Hey the man's all right

My Baby Just Cares for Me 

My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
Is somethin' he can't see
My baby don't care who knows
My baby just cares for me
Baby, my baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
He cares for me
My baby don't care
For cars and races
Baby don't care for
He don't care for high-tone places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Liberace's smile
Is something he can't see
Is something he can't see
I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for me

Killing Me Softly with His Song 

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
To listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
La la la, la la la
Ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh
La ahh ahhhhhh haaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ha ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh ahh
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me (softly)
He was strumming my pain
Yeah, he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song
