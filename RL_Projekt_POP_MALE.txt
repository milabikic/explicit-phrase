If I Can't Have You
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room (Yeah)
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance

Maniac
You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead so
You show up at my home all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause
People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?
You maniac

Call me crying in the dark
Now you're breaking my heart
So I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face
While you beg me to stay, well
People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy

Listen to yourself, think you need to get some help
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me

Old Me
Shout out to the old me
And everything he showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
Never a night alone
Anywhere you wanna go
Woke up in the morning
Wearing someone else's clothes
Pictures in my phone
With people I don't know
Woke up in the morning
How the hell'd I make it home?
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
But I wondered if I ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done
I would do it over now
I'd do it over
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me
Another round, here we go
Going in, blow for blow
Look into the mirror, take the punches that I throw
I'm constantly reminded
Of all the compromises
By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
But I wondered if I ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never shoulda done
I would do it over now
I'd do it over
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me
Devil at my door
Got me knocking, knocking, knocking
On the other side
Ashes on the floor
But I'm walking, walking, walking
Out of here alive
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me, ay, ay

Celestial
You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again
I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're going down
And I know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial
You see the light shinin' through the rain
A thousand colors in the brighter shade
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's a silver lining that surrounds the gray
When I get lost will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're going down
Know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial, ohh
We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things
When we notice that's what really matters is
Make tonight go on and on and on
You make me feel
(We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things)
You make me feel
(When we notice that's what really matters is)
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial, ohh
Celestial, ohh
Celestial, ohh
We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things
When we notice that's what really matters is
Make tonight go on and on and on

Forget Me
Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow, it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me dead
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe
Oh, I
Even after all, it still wrecks me
To find out you knew how to forget me
Even after all this time
Days ache and nights are grey
My heart is still your place, babe
Guess I still feel the same
Know you can't stand my face
Some scars you can't erase, babe
Guess you still feel the same
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe
Oh, I
Even after all, it still wrecks me
To find out you knew how to forget me
Even after all this time
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh (Even after all this time)
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe
Oh, I
Even after all, it still wrecks me
To find out you knew how to forget me
Even after all this time 

Loser
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I just might get a little too drunk so I won't think about us
I don't think about what we could have been
And I stay up like three or four nights so I won't dream about us
Wake up with no luck
I just can't win
I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
It hurts whenever someone says her name (Someone says her name)
When we were going off and on (Ah)
I guess I really played it wrong (Ah)
I should have never let her slip away
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I just might been a little too gone when she needed somebody
Up against her body (Ooh) at 2 am
Yeah, and now I keep lying to myself when she's just joking probably
(She's joking probably)
She'll probably call me and we'll be us again
I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
Now she's in love and I'm in second place (Damn)
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her? (Lose her)
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
Oh my, my, my, my

Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser
(I say) Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser
Tell me God is real
Do you think about me still
Or am I living for nothing?
Don't know where it went wrong but I'll just take the hint
It's gonna take some adjusting
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her? (I'll never)
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I'm a loser
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser (I say)
Oh my, my, my, my (Oh, I say)
Oh my, my, my, my (And I say)
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser 

How Do I Say Goodbye
Early morning
There's a message on my phone
It's my mother saying, "Darling, please come home"
I fear the worst
But how could you leave us all behind?
There's so much to say but there's so little time
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
When I couldn't, you always saw the best in me
Right or wrong, you were always on my side
But I'm scared of what life without you's like
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes
And I promise if you go, I will make sure she's alright
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
And there's no way you could ever let me down
Gonna steal some time and start again
You'll always be my closest friend
And someday we are gonna make it out
Just hold the light, just hold the light
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

The Best Is Yet To Come
There's nothing you could tell me
That would make me walk away
'Cause in my eyes you're perfect
And there's nothing I would change
I've seen you on your best days
And I'll see you on your worst, my love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know the last few years
Have been a test of character
Remind ourselves on darker days
The best is yet to come
In life, I've made a few mistakes
But you were never one, my love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be here if you need love, if you need strength
Forever by your side until the end
With me, you really don't have to pretend
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love

One Life
It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I gotta do
To be making a change now, the moment of truth
Why am I feeling so nervous when
Things are going so perfect ten?
But I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to her lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holding me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
The sun will reappear, burning auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass knoll was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way of falling deeper in you
Why was I feeling nervous when
Things were going so perfect ten?
And now I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be

Bad Habit

I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
What you, ooh, uh, what'd you do?
Made a move, could've made a move
If I knew I'd be with you
Is it too late to pursue?
I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear
Never gave me time of day, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I think are sure, yeah

Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah

I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed (I wish I knew you wanted me)
Now that you're back, I can't decide (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied and

Glimpse Of Us
She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she is so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working
So what can I do?
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
And find me again
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I can't stop the, I can't stop the
(I can't stop the feelin')
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feelin')
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on (Oh)
(I can't stop the feelin')
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance (Dance, dance, dance)
(I can't stop the feelin')
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
(I can't stop the feelin')
Everybody sing
Got this feelin' in my body
(I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feelin' in my body (Oh, no)
(I can't stop the feelin')
Wanna see you move your body (No, no, no)
(I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feelin' in my body, come on
Break it down
Got this feelin' in my body (Uh)
I can't stop the feelin'
Got this feeling in my body, come on (Ooh)
