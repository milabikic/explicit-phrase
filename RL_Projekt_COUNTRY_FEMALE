Early Morning Breeze
I open up my door to greet the early morning sun
Closing it behind me and away I do run
To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees
To have a word with God in the early morning breeze
A rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze

Jackson Ain’t a Very Big Town
Tonight at night we get married my friends all say it's a shame and disgrace
And he's loved every woman in Jackson oh but Jackson ain't a very big place
Tomorrow we'll go walking I count each one with a tear on her face
Then I'll know just how many think I'm lucky cause Jackson ain't a very big place
Jackson is a mighty small town where the gossips and the rumors go round
But the gossips are the ones he turned down and Jackson ain't a very big town
Jackson is a mighty small town

Gunpowder And Lead
County road two thirty-three under my feet
Nothin' on this white rock but little ol' me
I've got two miles 'til he makes bail
And if I'm right, we're headed straight for hell
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead
Well, it's half past ten, another six-pack in
And I can feel the rumble like the cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waiting here this time
Hey, I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead
His fist is big, but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm going to show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and, gunpowder and lead
Gunpowder and lead, yeah, yeah
Hey


You're Supposed To Be Feeling Good
Soulmate, I see you down there
Waiting for morning to softly be coming
I find I'm only in deeper and you'd be a leaver
If you weren't so scared
Your true love has made you feel better
But look out for later when she makes you feel worse
Times change in daydreams and flashes
A taste of the past is all I have seen
But you're supposed to be feeling good now
'Cause everybody said you would
Honey, does it blow your mind that the prophets would lie?
Well, you're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Feeling like you're down and out over someone like me
Soulmate, the blues are deceiving
It keeps us believing we're on the wrong road
One side is just like the other
Except for the color and size of the load
And just how much it shows
But you're supposed to be feeling good now
'Cause everybody said you would
Oh honey, does it blow your mind that the prophets would lie?
You're supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Just feeling like you're down and out over someone like me


Don’t Call Me
If you get yourself in another one of your binds
Run for help, yell for someone, pray for a sign
Dial 911, light a roadside flare
Up and run, I don't care
Just don't, don't call me
If your truck breaks down, if it all falls apart
Leave it on the shoulder, just get out, take a walk
If your shoes hurt your feet, take 'em off
Probably do ya some good, hell, maybe a lot
Just don't, don't call me
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
If you wake up in jail and they let you use the phone
Even if mine's the only number you know
You gotta figure it out on your own
You used up your favours a long time ago
So don't, well don't call me
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
Oh no you don't!
Well don't, don't call me
With another of your emergencies
Didn't you say you outgrew me
When you chose to up and leave?
Don't call me
Oh you don't call me
don't call me!
(Pick up a book and get self help) that's right, you don't call me!
(1800, go to hell, there's always been someone else) don't call me!
No, no, no (you can lean on your other ex)
(I know y'all still text) don't call me!
(Call your mom, she'll fix your mess) don't call me!
(Call your doctor!) You don't call me!
(Your lawyer if you can afford one) don't call me!
(Lose my number, don't call Brandi, and don't call me)
don't call me
(Your tattoo artist; somebody else can get this party started)

Greener Pasture
Ooh oh ooh
I'm sittin' on the front porch, cigarette burnin'
Them makers in my coffee sure ain't workin'
I see the dirt from where his boots used to lay
Still phantom pains after a couple a days
And I wonder if he ever thought about turnin' around
Bet he's past El Paso by now
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture (ooh)
Bet he's rollin' through a new town, and she's fallin' for his accent
She don't know that he's a dust cloud, he's beautifully tragic
He stays for the night, but he's gone by the morning
Let him ruin your life like a Tennessee storm
And this shouldn't tear you up, break you down this bad
Lovin' something you never had
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture
And all that ever mattered, livin' hard and livin' faster
Freedom was a dagger to a knife holder
There ain't no ever after, you're special, then you're shattered
Damn, he's got a way of leavin' his mark
Yeah, I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture (ooh)
But cowboys always find a greener pasture

Still Under The Weather
My first lesson losing a love was you
Learning to live with your memory was lesson number two
I can't lie, baby
I still cry sometimes
But I've come a long way
Towards gettin' you out of my mind
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
I still miss the shelter
Of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me
Has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
Sometimes your memory still gets the best of me
But that lonely ache in my heart
Ain't as bad as it used to be
Sometimes the way that I'm feelin'
Inside doesn't show
But I know
I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
And I still miss the shelter
Of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me
Has just made me strong
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm

Dooley's Farm
Old Dooley was raised Carolina
Got his schoolin' out in Vietnam
Tucks his hair up in a Pioneer seed cap
When he's bringing his cash crop in
Everybody said he's just a simpleton farmer
Plow a hundred acres out in Sugar Grove
Smilin' at you from an IH tractor
But there's a secret down in every row
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
Old Dooley's got a roadside farm stand
Sweet corn, tomatoes, and turnip greens
But if you ask to buy a jug of sorghum
He'll know exactly what you mean
He'll meet you in the back of the woods at midnight
Bring a lantern cause it's hard to find
He's got a strain that'll punch your lights out
Old Dooley's gonna blow your mind
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
You can hide by day but the night will find you
They caught Dooley in the moonlight
Drug him down from the field to the state farm
To bust rocks on the roadside
Now everybody says I'm just a simpleton farmer
But they don't know that I'm an outlaw
Growing green must've ran in the family
Cause old Dooley is my grandpa
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco then they made moonshine
But there's something better in the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco then they made moonshine
But there's something better in the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm

Your Drinkin', My Problem
Four a.m., stumbled to the bedroom again
'Cause I know where you're goin', you won't say where you've been
It was the bloodshot eyes that gave it away
Yeah, it's never my tab but I always pay
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Must be nice sleepin' 'til 11 o'clock like a rock
You lie to my face, not an ounce of shame in your walk
Oh, for the sake of my health, let's say that we're done
'Cause I feel like hell every time you get drunk
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Well, you can count me out for your next round
'Cause your livin' it up is bringin' me down
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
Yeah, I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Yeah, I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Yeah, my problem

The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said, "Hello"
He said, "Hi, what's new?"
And Wo said, "Sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt"
Said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth"
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself"
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home 'cause he didn't live far, you see
Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot, just to flag 'em down
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?"
The judge said "guilty" on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said, "Supper's waiting at home and I got to get to it"
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see little sister don't miss when she aims her gun
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Give It Time
I was going through the drawer at an old antique store
When a note on a page caught my eye
Words, they were sad, made my insides feel bad
Like it spoke from the man that I adore
He was moving on, he spent most of his nights gone
And I knew our love was ending
To this very day, I still get tears in my eyes
For the words that he never said
Give it time, write some letters
Give it time, you'll feel better
Soon I will fade from your mind
Give it time, no more sleepless nights
Give it time, you'll find the one that's right
You think that you still need me, give it time
And if you think that it won't last
You're probably just livin' in the past
And if you need someone to help you get through the night
Go out there, go ahead, find the light
And if you need some place to go, you're with me we'll go slow
To this very day, I still get tears in my eyes
For the words that he never said
Give it time, write some letters
Give it time, you'll feel better
Soon I will fade from your mind
Oh, give it time, no more sleepless nights
Give it time, you'll find the one that's right
You think that you still need me, just give it time

Hard As This
If you need space Take a trip Hijack you a ride on a rocket ship Hang out with the constellations Get yourself some isolation babe 
If you need time Here's a clock You can sit alone at night and listen to it tic and toc When it stops just wind it up 
I'll be somewhere giving up on you All my love is wasted on nothin but a heart ache in my chest You know how much 
I hate it Cause baby your the one who does it best Love shouldn't be so hard Hard as this If you need to think 
Read a book Read about some thief Stealing hearts like a crook See yourself there in the plot 
Realize you've got a lot to lose All my love is wasted on nothin but a heart ache in my chest You know how much 
I hate it Cause baby your the one who does it best Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard Hard as this 
All my love is wasted on nothin but a heart ache in my chest 
But honey you'll be aching to Cause I might be the one that you'll regret
Oh I coulda been the one for you but Lately I don't know what we got left Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard Love shouldn't be so hard
Oh love shouldn't be so hard Hard as this

I Can't Love You Anymore
Shoulda known what I was getting in
Fallin' for a boy from Michigan
You love your mom like every Midwest kid
You like driving to Texas
You put up with all my exes
To deserve you, don't know what the hell I did
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
Bring me coffee every morning
You're fun even when you're boring
And you like me even when I've been a bitch
You watch me while I'm gettin' ready
You lighten up my heavy
You're so good lookin' it kinda makes me sick
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk you down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now, aye, aye
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You're the angel to my devil
The pot to my kettle
To some I might be an acquired taste
You tell me I'm your favorite person
Hey, what we've got is working
And the years have only made it more that way
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
Heaven knows that I've attempted
Couldn't even put a dent in
I can't love you any more than I do now

Heart Like A Truck
I never stay in one place too long
A dirt road's singing me a siren song
I gotta find a field
I need to spin my wheels
I got a hankering for four wide tires
And I can't help it it's the way I'm wired
'Fore you get too close
Boy you need to know
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
There ain't no breaking when I throw it in drive
Don't always keep it in between the lines
If you're ready for a ride pedal down state of mind
Boy I tell you what
You better buckle up
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
Go on and see if you can knock off the dust yea
Shine it up revv it up and let it run yea
It gets a high riding off into the sun yea
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline

A little bit of love is all that it's needing

Truth No. 2
You don't like the sound of the truth
Comin' from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well, baby that might be so
I might get to the end of my life
Find out everyone was lyin'
I don't think that I'm afraid anymore
Say that I would rather die tryin'
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
This time when he swung the bat
And I found myself layin' flat I wondered
What a way to spend a dime
What a way to use the time, ain't it baby?
I looked at my reflection in the window walkin' past
And I saw a stranger
Just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
Why the world's dangerous
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
You don't like the sound of the truth
Comin' from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well, baby that might be so
Tell me what's wrong with havin' a little faith
In what you're feeling in your heart
Why must we be so afraid
And always so far apart?
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips

Big Family
It's bunk beds and matching sheets
Sharin' the bathroom sink
Fist fightin' over window seats all the way to KOA
It's more cousins than we have friends
A piggyback pyramid to fit us all in
And squintin' through a Polaroid lens on Thanksgiving Day
We learned how to ration apple pie
And how to dirty dance when Aunt Tina had too much wine
It's all husbands and ex-wives and boyfriends and pink lines
And the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family
It's "Hurry up" and "Wait your turn" and
Eat it all even if it's burned
It don't take too long to learn that the world don't revolve around you
We're a picture frame patchwork
Roots tangled in the same dirt
Little baggage, little hard work
It's all worth its weight
In husbands and ex-wives and boyfriends and pink lines
And the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family, ooh
Big family
We're thick skinned and stubborn
'Til the day we're six feet under
It's the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family, ooh
Big family, yeah
Big family

Matches and Metaphors
It's raining at my house, is it raining at yours?
When it rains it pours, to hell with the metaphors.
I want you so bad I think I might die
I'm sorry I keep feeding you these lines, but
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
I wrote you a letter. I threw it in the trash.
Got it out lit it with a match.
I'm not gonna tell you how I feel,
It's overrated but damn, it's real
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
If you don't want me, that don't bother me at all.
Don't be upset if I don't answer when you call.
Maybe I can move on, but there was nothing to move on from.
My veins are on fire, babe my face is numb
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
It's raining at my house, is it raining at yours

I've Been Loving You Too Long
I've been loving you too long to stop now
You are tired and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a habit to me
I've been loving you, a little too long
I don't wanna stop now
With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, our affair grows old
I've been loving you much too long
To stop now
I've been loving you much too long
I don't wanna stop now
Oh, please don't make me stop now
Oh, please I can't stop now
I've been loving you too long

Merry Go 'Round
If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday mornin', you best be there
In the front row like you're supposed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary quite contrary
We get bored, so we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
We think the first time's good enough
So, we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want, it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction
'Cause mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored, so, we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
Merry go 'round
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
And Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn no more

Back in Baby’s Arms
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Don't know why we quarrel
We never did before
Since we found out how it hurt
I bet we never quarrel anymore
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Thought I didn't need his love
Till he took it away
Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms

If Trouble Comes a Lookin’
What is there in Little Rock at the Hilton Double Tree
Just a woman far from home a thousand miles out to sea
She walks over to the window, pulls the curtain shut
Pours three fingers of whiskey in a flimsy plastic cup
Sits down on the bedspread, takes off her wedding ring
If she does something dark enough he might just set her free
It's her mother's mother's diamond in a shining golden band
Another woman who spent most her life loving the wrong man
If trouble comes a' lookin' she won't be hard to find
She's sitting in the hotel bar on her second glass of wine
She put a pretty dress on, wiped the tears out of her eyes
And if trouble comes a'lookin she won't be hard to find
Just two floors down is Brother John from Our Lady of Grace
He is older now but handsome still with such a lonely face
He picked a hotel off the Interstate where even God won't find him
Runs his fingers through the rosary and locks the door behind him
How was Christ so perfect, how on earth did he resist
The perfume on a woman's neck, the softness of her lips
He burned and burned for years with the fire of devotion
But some things are impossible to stop once they're in motion
If trouble comes a'lookin' he won't be hard to find
He's sitting in the hotel bar on his second glass of wine
Across the empty room he glances up to meet her eyes
And if trouble comes a lookin' he won't be hard to find
At quarter til the bartender will make the final call
She'll slip down off her stool and sway slowly down the hall
And he'll kiss her like she always wanted, back against the wall
And she'll step out of her dress looking like Eve before the fall
If trouble comes a lookin they won't be hard to find
They're tangled in each other's arms in room 229
They've never strayed this far into the shadows of the night
And if trouble comes a' lookin' they won't be hard to find
Not every infidelity is bound to end in shame
She'll smile one month later when a letter bears his name
Brother John has gone to France and Italy to travel
Where all of his ideas of God will happily unravel

Red Dress
Last night I ached and pleaded for candlelight and you
Walked the floor 'til midnight and cried ’til half past two
Then you come in with a flimsy grin and a flimsier excuse
With your shirt just reeking of cheap perfume and stale vermouth
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get me a new red dress and go out and paint the town
Get out on the dance floor, strut them curves around
And we’ll just see who thinks that I'm a ragged hand me down
Lately when you look at me, you been seeing a trinity
Your mama, the Irish washer woman and a whore from gay Paree
But I'm from Enid, Oklahoma and my name is not Marie
And I don't like the aroma of your third hand ecstasy
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get my new red dress and go out and paint the town
Hem line slit high on the thigh, lots of cleavage to bounce around
And we'll just see who thinks that I'm a ragged hand me down
I don’t like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I’m gonna get my new red dress and go out and paint the town
I just got one life to live and then I'm six feet under ground
And I don’t think I'm gonna live it as a ragged hand me down
You'll have to wash your own shirts now and hang 'em out on your line of balderdash
Take your hot stuff and your pickup truck down to First Street and pay cash
I ain’t the socket for your rocket, babe, I ain't your playtime clown
And I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I don't like being treated like a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna get me a new red dress and go out and paint the town
Gonna find someone to love me and what's in that scarlet gown
Someone who knows there's a lot more in it than a ragged hand me down
I'm gonna find someone to love me and what's in that scarlet gown
Someone who knows there's a lot more in it than a ragged hand me down

Sober & Skinny
Oh-oh-oh
Wow-oh-oh-oh
I empty the fridge
You empty the bottle
We're stacking up a mountain of hard pills
We'll have to swallow
It's strange how we point
I've lost it one another
We both got different vices
And they lead us to each other
Cause you owe the drink and I over eat
We're under thinking everything
And every night we swear it's gonna change
But in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Write the checks that we can cash
Keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (hmm-mmm)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (yeah, mmm)
You want being a shrink
While I think we should talk to one
Find a comfy couch and let out all the hurt
We've kept inside since we were young
That's so numb
Now we found ways to cover up
If we keep going out
We're going while we become
Cause in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Writing checks that we can cash
An keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, oh, oh
It's easy to imagine, imagine
All our problems disappear like magic, magic
But even on this world
You're not sober, I'm not skinny
We scraping by old borrowed pennies
Writing checks that'll never cash
Breaking all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
Maybe we'll grow old together
Waking up by our happy ending
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh, oh)
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
You'll get sober, I'll get skinny
It's easy to imagine
It's easy to imagine

Promises, Promises
You've promised you would be true to me but we both know you could never be
You've been puttin' you on since the day we met
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Then you promised me a ring a weddin' gown and all of them things
But I ain't seen no diamond yet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met you break my heart in two again I'll bet
But promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
And now you tell me you've gone away you swear to me that this time you'll stay
But I can't believe that I'm rid of you yet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met you break my heart in two again I'll bet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met...

He Wasn't Man Enough
Darkchild
Oh, yeah, yeah
Ha-ha, uh-huh
Yeah, uh, uh
Darkchild, yeah

Listen, girl
Who do you think I am?
Don't you know that he was my man?
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him?
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first?

What you thinkin'?
Stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance

Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah?
And not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

What are you thinking?
Do you know about us back then?
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend?
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave?
Do you know he begged to stay with me?
He wasn't man enough for me

Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worryin' about me
And hopefully you won't find
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

What you thinkin'?
Stop blaming me
He wasn't man enough for me
