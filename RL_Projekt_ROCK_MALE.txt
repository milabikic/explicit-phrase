Kids in the Dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa (The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
Whoa, whoa
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

Shots
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space?
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here
But I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishin' I had
What I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole (Oh, let me make it up to you)
Through every single thing that I loved
(Let me make it up to you)
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away (Let me make it up to you)
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Supermodel
Alone at parties in a deadly silhouette
She loves the cocaine, but cocaine don't love her back
When she's upset, she talks to Maury and takes deep breaths
She's a '90s supermodel, uh-uh-uh
Way back in high school, when she was a good Christian
I used to know her, but she's got a new best friend
A drag queen named The Virgin Mary takes confessions
She's a '90s supermodel
Yeah, she's a master, my compliments
If you wanna love her, just deal with that
She'll never love you more than money and cigarettes
Every night's a heartbreak
Hey, don't think about it, hey, just let it go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll (Hey)
Savor every moment 'til she has to go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll
Alone at parties, she's working around the clock
When you're not looking, she's stealing your Basquiat
Low-waisted pants on OnlyFans, I'll pay for that
She's a '90s supermodel
Yeah, she's a master, my compliments
If you wanna love her, just deal with that
She'll never love you, you just look a bit like her dad
Every night's a heartbreak

Strangers
Maybe I'll just be fucked up forever
Should have figured myself out by now
And I don't wanna tear myself open, no
But it's hard to care when you bleed out
So won't you break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room full of strangers
Well I guess my guardian angel missed the memo
'Cause we're walking on razors again
And we swore to God we'd never let this happen, no
We've dragged ourselves through hell and we'll be damned if we go back
Break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess that I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, it don't
Where did we go?
We're all alone, all alone
No place like home
Take us back to yesterday
S.O.S
Save us from ourselves
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room, we're just a room
We're just a room full of strangers

All the Things I Hate About You 
Haha
Take a bow
You've got everybody fooled, I got you figured out
Now you’re choking on your words, well, you should spit it out
Know that I gave you the world and you just gave me hell
And you gave me hell
Felt like a hundred punches
Too many tough pills to stomach
I watched you making it public
Lights, camera, fuck it
You're a showstopper
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about you
(All the things I hate about you)
You could’ve had a rockstar
But you chose up on a bum-star
Bootleg version of me, that's your loss
Had to find out through a photo
Hangin' on your arm like a knockoff
Stab me in the back like nothing
Never even saw this comin'
I watched you making it public
Lights, camera, fuck it
You're a showstopper
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about you
You won't break me again and say it's all in my head
Holdin’ his hand in that dress from the night that you left
I’m so sick of the pain, I'll never see you the same
Guess that’s the price that you pay for the mess that you made
You're a showstopper (Let's go)
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common (Okay)
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you (Yeah)
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me (Yeah)
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about—
Every single thing about you

Pass The Nirvana 
Yeah
Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear
Suicide season is upon and high
Why you always saying, "Let the good times roll"?
Kick your mind open like a punk rock show
Uppercut, bleeding through a softened nose
If you didn't come home injured, would you say it was a good show?
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tеnsion
Through the tension, right now
This is only a distraction
Swing, batter up, lеt's play
Power until the target bleeds
This gun would never turn on me
So, Paul Meany, will you drop that beat
Why you always saying, "Let that shit go"?
Pennywise fashion on a sad skid row
A gentrified neighborhood of blood-soaked homes
Draw the lines a little further, now they're coming back to get you
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
Yo, I can't shine to save my life
But I'll feel through the dark without you
I set fires ablaze inside
And stepped into the light to blind you
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
I can't hear you

​Maybe 
That's hard
Two, three, five
Maybe if I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There's shadows on the wall, wish I would've ran (Yeah)
Gotta get away, I hope you understand
I try to hide my face like a wanted man (Yeah)
Maybe I'll be gone before you count to ten
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking thе last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm rеady to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last
Maybe if we went another way (Another way)
I wouldn't be regretting the decisions that I made
I don't want to spend another day (Another day)
Looking for somebody that I know I can't replace
My tears fall, you don't miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history
I think I'm broke and nothing can fix me
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last
Yeah (Maybe)
We were built to fall apart
But I can't feel you now
And it's too late now, there's no point screaming
Dug your grave, so fuck your feelings
No one's here, so now you're on your own
Made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last

Black Summer 
A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon
(Hit me now)
Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew (Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton, the archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun
It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on anothеr black summer to end
It's been a long time and you nеver know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
Crack the flaming whip, a-sailin' on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end

San Quentin 
Let's get this circus on down the road
We're takin' bets how far a tank of gas will go
Call up your best friend, then call two more
About to do some shit that you ain't seen before
There ain't no backdoor, there ain't no sign
Location changes almost every other night
Last time we found it, can't remember much
I thought I was a God until my lawyer woke me up and said I
Testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Got out on bail, we hit the town
Somebody told me we should burn it to the ground
Too many favors, too much to drink
Come 6 AM, they had me back inside the clink
I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Tough to find, a goddamn alibi
Wrong or right, it's tough to justify
Can't dismiss, too many witnesses
When insanity's the pattern, it don't matter what it is
I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?

Face It Alone 
When something so near and dear to life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul is set on fire
When something so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside
Your cries can be heard
So loud and clear
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it all alone
When something so dear to your life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul is burned alive (Burned alive)
When somethin’ so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside
Your cries can be heard
So loud and clear
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it alone
When the moon has lost its glow
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da, da, da, da-doh
When the moon has
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da, da, da, da-doh
When the moon
When the moon has lost its glow
You have to face it all alone

Sweet Child O’ Mine 
She's got a smile that it seems, to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry
Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
Woah-oh-woah
Sweet child of mine
Ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sweet love of mine
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Mm-mm, oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Sweet child)
Mm-huh, where do we go now?
Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-oh (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Ooh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-oh, wow
Where do we go?
Oh-oh, where do we go now?
(Oh) Where do we go, oh-oh-oh-oh? (Oh, wow)
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Woah-oh, where do we go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Sweet child
Sweet child of mine

Gimme Shelter 
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, yeah
Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red-coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way
War, children, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children,yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Hey, hey
Rape, murder
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder (Woo)
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Yeah
Mmm, the flood is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, (kiss away, kiss away)

Back in Black 
Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Creep
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

Detroit Rock City 
...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...
"..Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day..."
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio, it goes
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why?
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Get up


Livin’ on a Prayer 
Once upon a time, not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer
Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Wish You Were Here 
And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes, now which is it?
I am sure of it
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

Everlong 
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head, she sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when

Something in the Way
Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped, have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass, and the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm

Basket Case 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?
And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah
(Ooh, ooh)
Grasping to control
So I better hold on
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?

Carry On Wayward Son 
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more, no
Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
But surely heaven waits for you
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry, don't you cry no more
No more

Born in the U.S.A. 
Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just coverin' up
Born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
Born in the U.S.A. 
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
Born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says, "Son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, "Son, don't you understand"
I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A. 
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A. 
Born in the U.S.A. 
Born in the U.S.A. 
I'm a cool rockin' Daddy in the U.S.A. now
