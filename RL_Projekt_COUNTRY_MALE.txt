When It Rains It Pours
Sunday morning, man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinkin' that her leavin'
Is the only logical reason
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

Springsteen
To this day, when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut off jeans
Somewhere between that settin' sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
We were just gettin' started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh"
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you
I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
Still be a spark
And back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what would mama think
'Bout your name on my arms
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound, roll the beat of a drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear "Born in the USA"
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me
Do you think about 17?
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky?
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Oh, Springsteen

Barefoot Blue Jean Night
A full moon shinin' bright
Edge of the water, we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and an old guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song
Never gonna grow up (Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down (Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught up in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Whoa-oh, never gonna grow up, ha
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show (Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right (Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive (Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught in a southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night (Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night

Head Over Boots
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor
Act like we never met before for fun, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
The way you sparkle like a diamond ring
Maybe one day we can make it a thing
Test time and grow old together
Rock in our chairs and talk about the weather, yeah
So, bring it on in for that angel kiss
Put that feel good on my lips, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
Yeah, I'm here to pick you up
And I hope I don't let you down, no, 'cause
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
You're the one I want, you're the one I need
Baby, if I was a king, ah, you would be my queen
You're the rock in my roll
You're good for my soul, it's true
I'm head over boots for you
I wanna sweep you off your feet tonight
I wanna love you and hold you tight
Spin you around on some old dance floor

Drunk On A Plane
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
'Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
Hmm, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim, hmm
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane

Toes
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther
I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for Tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play
The four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid goodbye to my friends
Because my bartender she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the Rum
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the people they call me Big Poppa
When I throw pesos their way
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jäger
And I'll grab my guitar and play
Going home now to stay
The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to stay
Going home now to stay
And put my ass in a lawn chair
Toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
Life is good today
Life is good today

Do I Make You Wanna
Baby what's on your mind?
When you see me pull up in your drive?
Do you wanna go downtown?
Maybe have a little high dollar wine?
Do you wanna go out to the country?
And maybe blow all our money
On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs
See if we can get lucky?
Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on
In your beautiful mind?
Baby don't be shy
And tell me now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down
Play a little truth or dare now
Act just like you don't care now
Girl, when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Stay up 'til the sun
Howl at the moon
Baby, tell me the truth
Do I make you wanna
Karaoke in the neon light
Go to Vegas, stay up all night
See if we can find a cheap flight
Little seven, come 11, baby, roll those dice
Do I make you feel pretty?
Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me?
Do you wanna roll with me
To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city?
Do you wanna take in a broadway show?
Or maybe just stay low?
I gotta know now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
Play a little truth or dare now
Act just like you don't care now
Girl when I come around
Tell me, do I make you wanna?
Do I make you turn into somebody else?
Do you feel like you can finally be yourself?
Baby, tell me now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Out in the middle of nowhere now?
We can take it back downtown
You know I don't care now
Just wanna take you there now
Do I make you wanna dance real slow? Go
Flyin' down a two lane road? Find
A limb to hang your clothes?
Do I make you wanna let your hair down

A limb to hang your clothes on (Oh)
Huh babe, tell me do I make you wanna

Wagon Wheel
Headin' down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-gettin' me down
Lost my money playin' poker, so I had to leave town
But I ain't a-turnin' back to livin' that old life no more
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Yeah, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke
But he's a-headin' west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I died in Raleigh, at least I will die free
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey... mama rock me
Oh, rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me
So, rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel (oh, I wanna feel)
Hey... mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a southbound train
Hey... mama rock me

Girl Like You
Love how you close your eyes
When I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah, you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top

Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

Hometown Girl
She grew up around here on that southwest side
Where the corn grows up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night
She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap
Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21
But she never forgot where she came from
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
Her mamma's mamma was born right here
And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl but she's not uptight
She can rise and shine and she can hang all night
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth
When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me
But there's nothing like the one right across the street
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl


Tennessee Whiskey
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey


Knockin’ Boots

Speakers, Bleachers And Preachers
You had a blue jean jacket, a burned CD
Said you wanna go somewhere fast with me
I picked you up
Yeah, and we turned it up
You had a broke heart necklace
Post-game smile
J Town front page news for awhile
Then we broke up
But I still turned it up
Cheerleading skirts and backseats
Free throws and church marquees
Kingsley countdown radio
Wouldn't know nothing if it weren't for all those
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss
The faster the car, more money you burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Story of my youth
Speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growin' up to do
Kroger parkin' lot, battle scars
Black and Mild on the dash under the stars
If Daddy asks they ain't mine
82 degrees on the bank sign
And hey, hey, summer jams
Any Chesney song gonna make her dance
When the sun goes down, yeah
I'll think about her now
And all those
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss
The faster the car, more money you burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Story of my youth
Speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growin' up to do
Subs from my system
Rattlin' my rearview
Used to listen with my cousin
I miss him, he's gone now
It was the national anthem
And a knee-down prayer we were actin'
Like we weren't just like every other small town
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah, the better they look, the sweeter they kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gonna miss
The faster the car, more money you burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Story of my youth

The Way I Talk
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it, them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheering on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man, it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Yeah it's, Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now
Fighting words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact, I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know
I sound a little bit like my daddy
I don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk

Loud and Heavy
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Pistons pumping
Minds are racing
It's hard to sleep, man
When I'm shaking
Bad news surrounds me
It's always found me
Creeping up when things are good
Yeah, the dark days find a way
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
The camra captures
All the things that
Make us turn from
What we see
It's always moving
It don't stop rolling
I haven't slept in three damn days
Yeah, but who needs that anyway?
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
Loud thunder heavy rain
Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
A long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Loud thunder heavy rain
Loud thunder heavy rain


Plain to See Plainsman
I cut through the Rockies like some unholy blade
The icy depths of the Pacific I have bade
Forever I wander, forever I stray
The rustle of wheat fields starts callin' my name
Callin' my name
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home
Well the North-folk are dandy, they don't mind the cold
The South has filled up both my belly and soul
I know when I'm gray and I know when I'm old
These bones will cry out for the place they were born
Place they were born
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home
I've met beautiful women, a pleasure to see
Road-bitten bikers and barefoot hippies
Junkies and saints on my travels I greet
But far too few are homesick young plainsmen like me
Plainsmen like me
Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home


I Love This Life
I love my boots broke in, I love my Camo hat
Don't mind a little paint on my jeans, yeah I roll like that
I love driving my truck across the railroad tracks
If you hit it too quick, it'll hit ya right back
I love a fresh cut field with a first frost on
How it shines like gold when the sun turned on
I love the sound of them wheels with my baby singing along
When "The Boys Of Summer" comes on
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rollin' through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
I Love that county line bar where they all know my drink
The way she throws her hands up when that cover band plays
I love that taste of her lips when she's been sipping that wine
I still get drunk on her every time
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through mind
Man, I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
I love that ragged old barn that my grandpa made
It was my whole world back in my innocent days
I love that little white church, out on 109
It's where I hit my knees and thank the Lord for this life of mine
I love my small town world
I love a country girl
I love a Friday night
Man I love this life
The sound of an ol' dirt road
Rolling through mind
Man I love, man I love
Man, I Love This Life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man I love this life
Oh-o-o-o-oh
Man, I love this life


Heaven
Mmm
This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this
Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (heaven)
Could be better than this (heaven, heaven)
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time


Telling on My Heart
Check out the moonlight filling up the night sky
Girl, how many times that you me sat right here
It always seems to get too late
Something tells me that I oughta wait
So while I got my courage up, and my mind still clear
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
Sayin' all kinds of crazy things
Like you're the only girl for me
Oh, baby, it was meant to be
And it just feels right
Yeah, how I think about you all the time
I can't seem to keep you off my mind
Kissing ain't the only thing I wanna do to you tonight
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
You know those secrets I've been keeping
Way down deep inside of me
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
'Cause I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I wanna tell you what I think
Underneath these stars
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart


Live Like You Were Dying
He said
"I was in my early forties
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the x-rays
And talkin' 'bout the options
And talkin' 'bout sweet time"
I asked him
"When it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit you
When you get that kind of news?
Man, what'd you do?"
And he said
"I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying"
He said
"I was finally the husband
That most of the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden going fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I, I finally read the Good Book, and I
Took a good, long, hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then
I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I'd been denying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
Like tomorrow was a gift
And you've got eternity
To think about
What you'd do with it
What could you do with it
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?
Skydiving
I went Rocky mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
Man, I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying"
And he said
"Someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying"
Woo


God's Country
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (yeah)
God's country
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country)
Yeah, I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country


Runnin’ Outta Moonlight
Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up, you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust that's my headlights, that's my truck
Come on baby, don't you keep me waitin'
I gotta go, I've got a reservation tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms
Whoa, girl every now and then you get a night like this
Whoa, this is one that we don't wanna miss, no
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
Girl I bet you thought I lost my mind
Outta the blue pulling into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear
Whoa, girl you never look better than you do right now
Whoa, oh heaven let your light shine down
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
Whoa, girl, every now and then you get a night like this,
Whoa, this is one that we don't wanna miss, no
Come on baby let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock now we're knocking on midnight
Me and you girl runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'till the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey baby, all we got is all night
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
Hey baby don't it feel so right
Come on now we're runnin' outta moonlight
All I wanna do is hold you tight come on, come on, come on we're runnin' outta moonlight
Whoa, yea we're runnin' outta moonlight, whoa


Beer in Mexico
Starin' out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and the lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should I try to grow up?
But who knows where to start
So I'll just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen 'em both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just tryin' to search my soul
For all the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go
So I'll just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Maybe I'll settle down, get married
Or stay single and stay free
Which road I'll travel is still a mystery to me
So I'll just sit right here, have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away
Down in Mexico


Burn Out
Watching cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts, how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
The smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done me wrong songs hit me so right
I'm so on fire for you it hurts, how
Fast as one cigarette can burn out
If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
It's a smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done me wrong songs hit me so right
I'm so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast as a cigarette can burn out
