Drugstore Rock and Roll 

Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
Drugstore on the corner of main
That's where you find all the bebop gang
The girls fill the jukebox and then demand
The jitterbug hand-in-hand
The boys have crew-cuts under their hats
The girls have leather sweaters, real cool cats
They're always together happy an' hep
Jumpin' to a rock 'n' roll step
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
The records have a slow beat, a fast beat too
As long as they're rockin' any beat will do
Kittens gettin' groovy all over the floor
And the cats are cryin' for more
Take time out for a soda pop
Dig a new record with a lot of bop
Ice cream cones and banana split
Ten jumps ahead of a fit
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll

Long Tall Sally 

Gonna tell Aunt Mary 'bout Uncle John
He claims he got the misery, but he has a lot of fun
Oh baby yea, oh baby ooh baby

Well long tall Sally, she's big as street
She got everything that Uncle John needs
Oh baby yea, oh baby ooh baby

Now I saw Uncle John with bald-headed Sally
Saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby yea, oh baby ooh baby
We're gonna have some fun tonight, yea
We're gonna have some fun tonight
We're gonna have some fun tonight, ooh

We're gonna rock and roll tonight

Rock and roll tonight, well everything will be alright
Have some fun, baby, have some fun tonight

Lucky Lips 

When I was just a little girl with long and silky curls
My mama told me: "Honey, you got more than other girls!
Now you may not be good looking, but you'll soon wear diamond clips
And you'll never have to worry, 'cause you've got lucky lips!"
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true!
I don't need a four-leave clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!
(With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!)
I never get heartbroken, no, I never get the blues
And if I play the game of love, I know I just can't lose
When they spin that wheel of fortune, all I do is kiss my chips
And I know I'm picked a winner, 'cause I've got lucky lips!
And I know I'm bound to win, yeah, 'cos I've got lucky lips!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true!
I don't need a four-leave clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!

My Baby Just Cares for Me 

My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
Is somethin' he can't see
My baby don't care who knows
My baby just cares for me
Baby, my baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
He cares for me
My baby don't care
For cars and races
Baby don't care for
He don't care for high-tone places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Liberace's smile
Is something he can't see
Is something he can't see
I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for me
