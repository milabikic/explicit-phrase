Supermodel
Alone at parties in a deadly silhouette
She loves the cocaine, but cocaine don't love her back
When she's upset, she talks to Maury and takes deep breaths
She's a '90s supermodel, uh-uh-uh
Way back in high school, when she was a good Christian
I used to know her, but she's got a new best friend
A drag queen named The Virgin Mary takes confessions
She's a '90s supermodel
Yeah, she's a master, my compliments
If you wanna love her, just deal with that
She'll never love you more than money and cigarettes
Every night's a heartbreak
Hey, don't think about it, hey, just let it go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll (Hey)
Savor every moment 'til she has to go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll
Alone at parties, she's working around the clock
When you're not looking, she's stealing your Basquiat
Low-waisted pants on OnlyFans, I'll pay for that
She's a '90s supermodel
Yeah, she's a master, my compliments
If you wanna love her, just deal with that
She'll never love you, you just look a bit like her dad
Every night's a heartbreak
Hey, don't think about it, hey, just let it go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll (Hey)
Savor every moment 'til she has to go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll
Yeah, huh-uh
She's a '90s supermodel, uh-uh-uh

Strangers
Maybe I'll just be fucked up forever
Should have figured myself out by now
And I don't wanna tear myself open, no
But it's hard to care when you bleed out
So won't you break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room full of strangers
Well I guess my guardian angel missed the memo
'Cause we're walking on razors again
And we swore to God we'd never let this happen, no
We've dragged ourselves through hell and we'll be damned if we go back
Break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess that I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, it don't
Where did we go?
We're all alone, all alone
No place like home
Take us back to yesterday
S.O.S
Save us from ourselves
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room, we're just a room
We're just a room full of strangers

All the Things I Hate About You 
Haha
Take a bow
You've got everybody fooled, I got you figured out
Now you’re choking on your words, well, you should spit it out
Know that I gave you the world and you just gave me hell
And you gave me hell
Felt like a hundred punches
Too many tough pills to stomach
I watched you making it public
Lights, camera, fuck it
You're a showstopper
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about you
(All the things I hate about you)
You could’ve had a rockstar
But you chose up on a bum-star
Bootleg version of me, that's your loss
Had to find out through a photo
Hangin' on your arm like a knockoff
Stab me in the back like nothing
Never even saw this comin'
I watched you making it public
Lights, camera, fuck it
You're a showstopper
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about you
You won't break me again and say it's all in my head
Holdin’ his hand in that dress from the night that you left
I’m so sick of the pain, I'll never see you the same
Guess that’s the price that you pay for the mess that you made
You're a showstopper (Let's go)
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common (Okay)
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you (Yeah)
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me (Yeah)
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about—
Every single thing about you

Pass The Nirvana 
Yeah
Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear
Suicide season is upon and high
Why you always saying, "Let the good times roll"?
Kick your mind open like a punk rock show
Uppercut, bleeding through a softened nose
If you didn't come home injured, would you say it was a good show?
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tеnsion
Through the tension, right now
This is only a distraction
Swing, batter up, lеt's play
Power until the target bleeds
This gun would never turn on me
So, Paul Meany, will you drop that beat
Why you always saying, "Let that shit go"?
Pennywise fashion on a sad skid row
A gentrified neighborhood of blood-soaked homes
Draw the lines a little further, now they're coming back to get you
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
Yo, I can't shine to save my life
But I'll feel through the dark without you
I set fires ablaze inside
And stepped into the light to blind you
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
I can't hear you

​Maybe 
That's hard
Two, three, five
Maybe if I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There's shadows on the wall, wish I would've ran (Yeah)
Gotta get away, I hope you understand
I try to hide my face like a wanted man (Yeah)
Maybe I'll be gone before you count to ten
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking thе last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm rеady to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last
Maybe if we went another way (Another way)
I wouldn't be regretting the decisions that I made
I don't want to spend another day (Another day)
Looking for somebody that I know I can't replace
My tears fall, you don't miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history
I think I'm broke and nothing can fix me
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last
Yeah (Maybe)
We were built to fall apart
But I can't feel you now
And it's too late now, there's no point screaming
Dug your grave, so fuck your feelings
No one's here, so now you're on your own
Made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last

Black Summer 
A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon
(Hit me now)
Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew (Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton, the archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun
It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on anothеr black summer to end
It's been a long time and you nеver know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
Crack the flaming whip, a-sailin' on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end

And your friends threesoming, they talkin' all these discussions
And we at the table speakin' who freaky and doin' what when we back at the spot
Magnums come out the box and never go back in the box
She take shots like backshots, she's backing the shots

Bust it then I reload, yeah-yeah-yeah
Tryna see how bad you can get when you're drunk
Even though you're dangerous, I love the way you walk
Seems like you're anxious, don't gotta hide your scars
Imperfectly perfect, not a single flaw, nah, nah, nah
My bag different, count up mad chicken
From New York, she like my accent, I make her act different
She want Richard Mille status, get the Patek
Cut from a different cloth, she a different fabric
She think I need sex everyday
Hop inside the double R, just take me away
Your eyes look like the stars when we fuck in the Wraith
We both got Amiri on our legs, grab yo' waist and lift yo' legs to yo' waist, look
Get a new car, don't touch nothin'
Sit in the car, let's discuss somethin'

First to park Rolls Royce, 'vert in the hood
Don't worry about us, over here we good
The AP Roman numeral, everywhere I go, I need pharmaceuticals
I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin' shit out in the cubicle
Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot
Big ol' ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that bitch look like a Ring Pop
Money on my mind, money on your head
Can't ride three times while you comin' through the 'jects
Red Cross kept a nigga fed
In the studio with K. Dot fresh out the feds
Yeah, you niggas can't stand the rain, you niggas don't stand a chance
Yeah, Chevrolet candy paint, I spin the bend in the Benz
I caught a bale off a Google app
I'm the type to get my shooter whacked
I had to survive off a tuna pack
Five percent tint on the whip like, "Who was that?"
Coupe take off like it's mad
Beat the dope with a fork, I'm whippin' up Sudafed, I'm doin' scams in the lab
Every Thursday, girl's day, spendin' time with my daughter, make me go harder
Every Sunday's son's day, teach my boy to be a man, I ain't had no father
Fell in the love with the block, I ain't have no pop, just a sawed-off shotgun, Mossberg
We stackin' that money up proper, awkward diamonds, look like marbles

Trench Kid preachin' like a pastor
You been on my mind, shit been out of line
Normally, I be on Casper
Normally, I keep it smooth
Guard up high like I'm a master
But it's somethin' 'bout you
I can't see through
I got some funny feelings in my head and, girl, I don't know what to call it (Call)
Too iffy and quick, I can't say that it's love, but I know that I want some more of it (More)
These feelings been stuck in my head, ain't too big on love, but with you, I'm all for it (No)
See the world, me and you, we can tour it
Like, fuck all them bitches, ain't shit to ignore it (Oh)
Daily, you be on my mind, my heart hurt, beat, and bruised from the owner before it (Oh)
Got a good feeling this time, I been focused on you and I cannot ignore it (No)
Better than all of them combined
See, nothin' better than callin' you mine (Oh)
You a ten out of ten, you a dime
Fuck all the others, leave that shit behind
Sidestep, that's my flex
And you gon' die if you keep tryna play games
All I know is treacherous, fuck around, it's straight flames
Hate pain, but it's all through my veins
Rollin' dope, it go straight to my mind
How you be feelin', I'm one of a kind
Can't no one hold me back, how they gon' hold me back?
Destined to win, ain't no blockin' my shine
Took me a minute, I waited
Every year, shit get greater, I'm stuck in my prime
Soon get better, it's way more than fine
I be the type to just say less and grind
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like​
Na-na-na-na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

MAFIA 
Custom the things, custom the wings
I had to custom the vibe, custom the link up
Cover the back of the lab, front cover magazine
Cover your eyes, cuddled up, back of the V (Yeah)
Our chemistry, just like the trappers and fiends (Ooh)
Our misery really ain't nothin' to see
I gotta travel the V, I like to travel to heat (Ooh)
Bring out a bag of the weed
Did I tell you I got my own weed? I had a lot to achieve
Blew it out and I'm relieved, take it down, now you relieve
Rather you leave, then you go back out on me
Don't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least
You know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week
Movin' at rapid speed, like it's a track, we meet
We got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah
Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust
Like it thick with a bounce, we all in the count
Wine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with the wave
Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house
You come with two when it's late, know the brown one is my fav'
Then Mike Brown gon' walk you out (Walk you out)
Step by step, watch yourself
Cleaners got anything you might've left
I couldn't do none of this by myself
With mafia, they in the tuck
I gave you fifty to boost up your butt
I gave you the juice, you'd rather get buzzed
I tried to choose you, you'd rather go club
Know what to do, you rattled me up
Common denominator, we were steps from the diamond ages
Got a couple of vibrations
For the simulation, gotta re-up the hydration
Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked (Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall through this town today)
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas around)
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust (We still pourin' up for the niggas that can't be around today)
Mm, mm, woah-ah, mm-mm
Woah, mm-mm, mm-mm
Fuck shit up at the club (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Drop down
Run around, run around
Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked (Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall through this town today)
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas around)
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust (We still pourin' up for the niggas that can't be around today)

JUST LIKE YOU 
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
It's strange the way the mind can wander, but also stop to gossip
And chat with memories that you and me aren't really fond of
Maybe you're out to find love, maybe you lost who you was
Maybе you're just like me and feel thе need to stay in your rut
'Cause if you left it, you might feel like you're no longer you
It's so impressive, the way the mind can play with the truth
It's interestin' that nobody can walk in your shoes
But still relate and feel the same, so in a way, guess we do
You ever think about what it would be like
If the clouds were gone and you could see light?
If the door was open, would you take flight
Or just close the curtains up and stay inside?
Take a walk with me, take a risk with me
I'm scared too and it gets so tempting
When you're so empty, to disown everything
You hold dearly when you know clearly
You been so buried in your own fairytale
The soul's tearin' bunch of holes in me
I relate to it, but in case you been
Thinkin' no one does, here's a great theory
Throw a Hail Mary, let ya mind fly
To the sun rise, could be so scary
Make your faith vary, feel the pain glaring
But the weight carried ain't in vain, hear me? (Hear me?)
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
So often I feel desperate, I think my heart's infected
How 'bout yours? How 'bout yours? How 'bout yours? I guess if
You feel the best when your life is hectic, you might be destined
To stay defective, so join the club, it ain't that hard to get in
It's hard to leave though, look at the guest list
I bet that your name is on it, don't believe me? Check it
See dead ends
In life we come to tend to raise some questions
Suggestion
Know that your feelings might give wrong directions (Infested)
Yeah, with the feeling of failure
Let it take over your body, it makes ya
Question the life that you have, situations
You might have enjoyed become nothin' but dated
Old and forgotten, but what would you say if
I told you that there was some hope we could make it?
I know what you're thinkin', I'm thinkin' it too
Could you really improve and be somethin' worth savin'?
See, I could pretend like I have all the answers
But none of us do, it's the reason we battle
Convincing yourself that you don't really matter's
Like feedin' a cancer and letting it travel
To every part of you, but what if we did
The unthinkable and cancel our trips?
What's achievable depends on the risk
So pick up your chin and listen to this
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you (You, you, you, you)
Yeah, everybody falls sometimes
Just remember that that's alright
It's the rainy days that give us love for the sun
And if it isn't, I guess I'll be fine believin' it does, oh yeah
Everybody falls sometimes
Just remember that that's alright
It's the lows in life that make you cherish the highs
And if it isn't, I guess I'll be fine believin' a lie (Ayy)
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you

They put me down, but I never cried out, "Why me?"
Word from the wise, don't put worth inside a nigga that ain't try

Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it

As It Was
Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was

Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us

I Ain't Worried

But time is running out, no need to take it slow
I'm stepping to you toe-to-toe
I should be scared, honey, maybe so
But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below
I ain't worried 'bout it

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out so spend it like it's gold
I'm living like I'm nine zeros
Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)
I'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal
Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal
I'll take it in and let it go
But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

Celestial
You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again
I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're going down
And I know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial
You see the light shinin' through the rain
A thousand colors in the brighter shade
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's a silver lining that surrounds the gray
When I get lost will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're going down
Know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial, ohh
We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things
When we notice that's what really matters is
Make tonight go on and on and on
You make me feel
(We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things)
You make me feel
(When we notice that's what really matters is)
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial, ohh

We were made to be
Nothing more than this

Forget Me
Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow, it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me dead
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe
Oh, I
Even after all, it still wrecks me
To find out you knew how to forget me
Even after all this time
Days ache and nights are grey
My heart is still your place, babe
Guess I still feel the same
Know you can't stand my face
Some scars you can't erase, babe
Guess you still feel the same
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe
Oh, I
Even after all, it still wrecks me
To find out you knew how to forget me
Even after all this time
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh (Even after all this time)
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh
I'm not ready to let you forget me
To let you forget me, to let you for, oh
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry

Loser
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I just might get a little too drunk so I won't think about us
I don't think about what we could have been
And I stay up like three or four nights so I won't dream about us
Wake up with no luck
I just can't win
I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
It hurts whenever someone says her name (Someone says her name)
When we were going off and on (Ah)
I guess I really played it wrong (Ah)
I should have never let her slip away
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I just might been a little too gone when she needed somebody
Up against her body (Ooh) at 2 am
Yeah, and now I keep lying to myself when she's just joking probably
(She's joking probably)
She'll probably call me and we'll be us again
I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
Now she's in love and I'm in second place (Damn)
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her? (Lose her)
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
Oh my, my, my, my

Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser
(I say) Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser
Tell me God is real
Do you think about me still
Or am I living for nothing?
Don't know where it went wrong but I'll just take the hint
It's gonna take some adjusting
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her? (I'll never)
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I'm a loser
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser (I say)
Oh my, my, my, my (Oh, I say)
Oh my, my, my, my (And I say)
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser 

How Do I Say Goodbye
Early morning
There's a message on my phone
It's my mother saying, "Darling, please come home"
I fear the worst
But how could you leave us all behind?
There's so much to say but there's so little time
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
When I couldn't, you always saw the best in me
Right or wrong, you were always on my side
But I'm scared of what life without you's like
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes
And I promise if you go, I will make sure she's alright
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
And there's no way you could ever let me down
Gonna steal some time and start again
You'll always be my closest friend
And someday we are gonna make it out
Just hold the light, just hold the light
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

The Best Is Yet To Come
There's nothing you could tell me
That would make me walk away
'Cause in my eyes you're perfect
And there's nothing I would change
I've seen you on your best days
And I'll see you on your worst, my love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know the last few years
Have been a test of character
Remind ourselves on darker days
The best is yet to come
In life, I've made a few mistakes
But you were never one, my love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be here if you need love, if you need strength
Forever by your side until the end
With me, you really don't have to pretend
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love

One Life
It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I gotta do
To be making a change now, the moment of truth
Why am I feeling so nervous when
Things are going so perfect ten?
But I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to her lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holding me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
The sun will reappear, burning auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass knoll was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way of falling deeper in you
Why was I feeling nervous when
Things were going so perfect ten?
And now I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be

Late Night Talking
Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you
Mmm, yeah
When nothing really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera

Bad Habit
I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
What you, ooh, uh, what'd you do?
Made a move, could've made a move
If I knew I'd be with you
Is it too late to pursue?
I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear
Never gave me time of day, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I think are sure, yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me (I wish I knew)
I wish I knew (Oh), I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (Yeah), I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)

Please say to me (Please, just say to me)
If you still want it
I wish you wouldn't play with me
I wanna know (I wanna know)
Uh, can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?
Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
Now you're not too good for me, my dear
Funny you come back to me, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (Wish I knew), I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)
You can't surprise a Gemini (I wish I knew)
I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed (I wish I knew you wanted me)
Now that you're back, I can't decide (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied and
I turn it on and make it rowdy
Then carry on, but I'm not hidin'
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
It's biscuits, it's gravy, babe

But you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
I knew you'd come back around
'Cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
Let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
Go stupid, go crazy, babe
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end
You'll miss me, don't beg me, babe

Glimpse Of Us
She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she is so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working
So what can I do?
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
And find me again
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us

Old Me
Shout out to the old me
And everything he showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
Never a night alone
Anywhere you wanna go
Woke up in the morning
Wearing someone else's clothes
Pictures in my phone
With people I don't know
Woke up in the morning
How the hell'd I make it home?
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
But I wondered if I ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done
I would do it over now
I'd do it over
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me
Another round, here we go
Going in, blow for blow
Look into the mirror, take the punches that I throw
I'm constantly reminded
Of all the compromises
By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
But I wondered if I ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never shoulda done
I would do it over now
I'd do it over
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me
Devil at my door
Got me knocking, knocking, knocking
On the other side
Ashes on the floor
But I'm walking, walking, walking
Out of here alive
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me, ay, ay 

Anti-Hero
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman?
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving and life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it
And then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from hell!"
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me
Hi
Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees
It's me
Hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Time)
Everybody agrees
(Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Countin' while I run the tap
I'm on my knees
Chokin' on my hands all night
In my sleep
Countin' all the calories
Now get 'em up
Body positivity
Help me out
The swans of ballet
Their skin and their bones, that's not me

Break 'til I wither away
What I see is not me

One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?

I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in
What I see is not me
What I see is not me

Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die

Their skin and their bones, that's not me (Me)
I'd die for my love though, break (Break)
Break 'til I wither away
What I see is not me
What I see is not me

Then everyone gets lost
But I'm learnin' every time I feel out of place

SNAP
It's 4 am
I can't turn my head off
Wishin' these memories would fade
They never do

Had your ass sittin' courtside with your arm around me
Had your ass sittin' first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi
Could've been what we should've been but you lost a bet, now you gotta find me
Find a seat, nigga
I ain't playin' this hide and seek
High school when you finally peaked
Hound dog, come find a treat
I'm a bad bitch but (You ain't nothing but a)
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it

Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
Yeah, yeah, I said (You ain't nothing but a)
I get it, I know you got some other shit you wanted
I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong
So I reckon, you leave all of your problems at the door to my city
You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks
When I release you in them sheets (You ain't nothing but a)
And keep my meaning discreet
Keep the clean in my Jeep
And put that Yeezy in your teeth
Let my demons off their leashes
If you even think to speak
I'ma give a whole new meaning
When you said you live in a dream
We can keep that shit asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your Gs
Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep
Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R-I-P
(You ain't nothing but a)
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it

Bam Bam
You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now (Mmm)
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Yeah, that's just life, baby

Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam
It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now
I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'

Eh! 

Boyfriend
I can't believe we're finally alone
I can't believe I almost went home
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
And he's not with you (Hm, hm, hm, hm)
The universe must have divined this
What am I gonna do?
Not grab your wrist?
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend
I don't need to tell you twice
All the ways he can't suffice
If I could give you some advice
I would leave with me tonight
The universe must have divined this
Mm, mm, mm
Ladies first, baby, I insist
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could be a better boyfriend
I never would have left you alone
Here on your own
Glued to your phone
Never would have left you alone
For someone else to take you home
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus you know my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit

Not Another Rockstar
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Pinky promised I was quittin'
Pinky promised that I wouldn't love somebody if they didn't
I'm a girl with big ambitions, but did I listen?
No, no, no, no
They're tortured and I wouldn't understand it
Plus they got a lot of unexamined father/son baggage
They don't wanna talk about it, is that a challenge?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsessive and I sign up, sign up
Ooh
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
He's been a player since the cradle
Aren't I lucky 'cause he could have chosen any girl to fuck with?
And he chose me, so I guess I should be grateful
No, no, no, no
Hmm, funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsessive and I sign up, sign up
Where's the pen? Where's the line?
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Ooh, not another rockstar
Ooh, not another rockstar
Glad that I got out before it got dark
You could be a better person, no, it's not hard
If there was a moment in this where you saw it goin' different, tell me what part
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar" 

Nonsense
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to don't leave me alone
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen now you got me feelin' thrown
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like bleh, blah, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song I wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill I must have lost it
I don't even know I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking, all around clock
I'm talking hope nobody knocks
I'm talking opposite of soft
I'm talking wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like blah, blah, bleh, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill I musta lost it
I don't even know I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking
I'm talking
I'm talking
This song catchier than chicken poxes
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning thought I'd write a pop hit
How quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz?

uh oh
Feel your eyes watchin' me
So I'm movin' on him just so you can see
Told you I was gonna get you right back
Oh, you don't really like that? (Oh)
I'm yours again (Oh) when you walk away (Oh)
You know if you leave, I ain't gonna stay (Oh-oh-oh)
When I'm doin' good, you get me off track (Oh)
And I guess I kinda like that (Oh)
You make me really, really good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missin'
Seven texts and two missed calls
Know I can't ignore 'em all
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied
Uh, uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb
Uh-oh, now we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
Roll your eyes, like you do
Should have known it's always the same with you
Tryin' not to feel our connection
But, oh my god, it's kinda temptin'
You said, "Can we leave now?" (Oh)
I don't think we should (Oh)
Through the back door (Oh)
That won't end good (Oh)
How 'bout my place?
Shit, you know I would (Oh)
Then I follow you out
Hope nobody looks
You make me really, really good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missin'
Seven texts and two missed calls
Make you wait before I fall
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied
Uh, uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb
Uh-oh, now we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
(Again, again)
Again, again
(Again, again)
Again, again 

W.I.T.C.H.
Rumor on the street is that her apples are delicious
The jury said she's charming but her exes say she's wicked
I swear to god I saw her howling at the sky
She ain't out to get you but she's better on your side
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself
Villainous kitty queen, she's got tricks up her sleeve
And I got a few up mine
She said, am I bad to the bone cause I get what I want
Mama said it ain't no crime
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Come out and play, it's fun in the dark
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge
Baby don't run, you're breaking my heart
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, what a woman, woman, yeah
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself 

TV
I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade
Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
And I don't get along with anyone
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem

How Could You
You said you were sober
So I let you come over
Your words pulled me closer
But your words fuck me over
I kept on denyin'
So you kept on tryin'
You went too far for closure
Too far fucked me over
I could just lie here, say, "It's okay"
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
Set it on fire and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you? How could you?
Oh, I more than regret you
You've convinced yourself I let you
The better version of me never met you
Never let you in my bedroom
Oh, all those shitty lines and crooked blinds
And cheap red wine stains
Threaten suicide to change my mind
And keep me afraid
You want me to lie here, and say, "It's okay"
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
Set it on fire and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you? How could you?
I once loved a liar
'Cause he knew my name
Would rewrite the story
And make me to blame
How could you?

October Passed Me By
I keep the letters that you wrote
In a secret place
Every now and then I go
Down memory lane
October passed me by
Just like any month
But I still think of the times
You took the breath out of my lungs
You don't have to run
Yeah, I got bitter when you got cold
Could you really blame me though
'Cause I'm still tied up when you go
You know this song is about you
Who else could it be?
You were the first to make me
Feel like I was me
Just a memory
It wasn't all good, yeah
It wasn't all pretty
Lost our grip
While tryna go steady
Holding on to you like maybe
One day we'll meet
I met you at the wrong time
Didn't wanna see
I was busy with the stars
You were looking at me
For better or for worse
I don't know
But for what it's worth
I made you my whole world
I made you my whole world
Screaming at the top of my lungs, "I love you my girl"
Always in the back of my mind
You'll be my girl 

Cherry Forest
She lookin' like cinnamon (woo-ooh)
Long black heels bought by no man (woo-ooh)
Two jobs so she can try and bring him home
'Cause, girl, you know he tied up by the man (ooh-ooh)
Her love is the pinnacle of the world, it's heaven-sent
Oh, thought they could tell it, "Shut up, " it keeps spreadin'
It got all the people talkin' 'bout it, but who could do without
All the circles pointin' back to where we started? (started)
Waitin' in the storm (ooh-ooh)
Underneath the cherry forest
Time brings changes in the story
Find your way back to your glory (oh, ooh-ooh oh)
That beauty's so evident (woo ooh-oh)
They wanna worry your pretty lil' skin (woo ooh-oh)
Hold your soul in a world oh, so cold (ooh)
One day, we'll all find a wonderland (I know we will, ooh)
Our love is the pinnacle of the world, it's heaven-sent
All the circles pointin' back to where we started
Waitin' in the storm (waitin' in the storm)
Underneath the cherry forest
Time (time) brings (brings) changes in the story
Find your way back to your glory
Oh, ooh-oh oh (yeah)
I'll be waitin' (yeah) all night (ooh)
Somethin' tells me everything is alright (everything is alright)
I'll be waitin' (ooh) just fine
Cherry drops keep fallin' just to bloom in springtime (yeah, yeah)
I'll be waitin' all night (I'll be waitin' all night)
Somethin' tells me everything is alright (oh, it's right)
I'll be waitin' just fine (I'll be waitin', oh)
Cherry drops keep fallin' just to bloom in springtime (cherry drops, yeah)
I'll be waitin' all night (I'll be waitin', oh)
Somethin' tells me everything is alright (alright)
I'll be waitin' just fine (I'll be waitin' just fine)
Cherry drops keep fallin' just to bloom in springtime (bloom in springtime)
(Cherry drops)
And the cherry fallin' symbolizes new beginnings
Things that are of old ending
So watch where you're takin' your time (da-dada-da)
Watch how you're spendin' your time
Show how you're spendin' your love
I'ma show how I'm spendin' mine
Da-dada-da, da-da-da

Static
Baby, you got somethin' in your nose
Sniffin' that K, did you feel the hole?
Hope you find peace for yourself
New boyfriend ain't gon' fill the void
Do you even really like this track?
Take away the drugs, would you feel the noise?
More and more you try to run away
You fucking yourself, do you feel the toy?
Uh, lookin' for a bitch 'cause I'm over boys
Would you be my girlfriend, baby?
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Somethin' turned me off
Smoking made me
'Cause I'm longing
For somethin' secure
If you had to (if you) stunt your shining (oh, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah)
For your lover, dump that fucker
Shoo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Shoo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Shoo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Shoo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, no

Killing Me
You
You
Why, do I depend on you?
6 then I'm 'bout to pull up
Think 'bout your body too much
I'm feeling you for real
Missin' the party for what?
There ain't nobody but us
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through (uh)
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right you're killing me
That's right you're killing me
Adrenaline gentlemen, baby
Skeletons that I don't hold back
Try to stop, do you feel relaxed?
Love it when you make me feel like that
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through (uh)
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life

Ten thousand (ten thousand)
Twenty thousand (twenty thousand)
Thirty thousand (thirty thousand)
Forty thousand (forty thousand)
How much I'ma spend profilin'?
She come in and compliment my closet
Fuck her on the floor like I don't give a fuck 'bout it
Your judgement get clouded when you clouted
My opposition wish I'd stop smilin'
My family wish I'd stop wildin'
I'm still on the east side smokin' with my OG's
'Cause they the only ones that really know me
I was fuckin' superstars when I was nineteen (hmm)
The shit we did, you won't believe me
Now I'm at the turn up, lookin' lonely
Then they wonder why I'm quiet at them house parties
'Cause everybody see me (see me)
Roll some blunts and hit her once and now she need me (need me)
Her nigga wanna be me (yeah)
But they don't know I'm fightin' demons
I feel like dyin' every season
I've been swimmin' in the deep end
All my bitches know I'm leavin' at some point (mm, I'm out)
Whether there's a reason or not
Don't try givin' me reasons to stop

Miss Summer
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time, living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Every night, I recall this same love (on and on again)
Although my dreams are all she's made of (on and on again)
Like a truce to be made
There's two sides to the pain
Pray I choose right anyway
Wired to chasе love
Wipe my tears in thе face of death
No need for a chaser
Hoping the moment don't fade 'til I'm high again
Focus on mine, keep faith, and we'll fly again
Love, at least I can when you're right here
I know the feeling might change when the night ends
Unless the world stops for you, but
Oh, there she goes, Mrs. Summer
Breaking hearts again
While I wait for her number
She plagues my mind again
I hope we never end
Take my time living in pretend
'Til I play my role, she'll be running
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
On and on again

Yourself around me
Sugar, well you're trippin', I know we'll make up and make love

Sunset Eyes
Feels like our love's in eclipse
It's like it has a different you to it
The room, the mood
The moonlight was dim
I know you felt that, right?
That night, I couldn't describe
The feeling when I saw the sunset in your eyes
'Cause I, I knew something wasn't right
The sight of us was fallin'
That night, I couldn't describe
The moment when I realized that it was time for us
To say that somethin' isn't right
The thought of us has faded away
Feels like we're forcing this
Even your touch has different weight to it
You kiss my lips and I'm indifferent
I didn't feel that high
That night (that night), I couldn't describe
The feeling when I saw the sunset in your eyes
'Cause I, I knew that something wasn't right
The sight of us was fallin'

To say that somethin' isn't right

One
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No need, it's too late (would I have to suffer?)
Goddamn, this pressure is having me feeling frustrated
And all this bad weather followin' me like we datin'
Tryna be what they dream, what they fantasize
And still be me, me, myself at the same fuckin' time
And man, it's never been like this, I'm feelin' so faded
And not in the good way that you get from drinkin' Jamie
Tryna see where life leads, what the future lies
Anxiety all on me, keepin' me up at night
It's already rough dealin' with this stuff
Don't know if I'll move up, am I good enough?
One step at a time (hello), yeah (hello)
I've got to lighten up, stop being so tough
But when I make it up the way I dreamed of
Will I ever find it? (Hello, hey), yeah, yeah, yeah
And I don't know if I'll ever succeed
I just want you proud of me up above
(What you seek, you will find when you look inside)
(All these things on your mind, just a waste of time)
One thing I promise, I'll make you happy
Don't forget that I will never give up
Shit, it's been a week, only felt like a one day
Tryin' to get some sleep, time itself keeps on warpin'
You and me just ain't working right
Just like that, what a thing is to realize
Never call 'em back, pretty whack, that's my forté
Tryna get the stack, platinum racks, but the right way
All my love workin' overtime
And for what? Just to feel like I done missed my prime
It's already rough dealin' with this stuff
Don't know if I'll move up, am I good enough?
One step at a time, yeah (one step at a time, whoa)
I've got to lighten up, stop being so tough
But will I make it up the way I dreamed of?
Will I ever find it? (Will I ever find it?)

One thing I promise, I'll make you happy (thing I promise)

No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No need, it's too late
No more, it's too late
No more, it's too late

Telling on My Heart
Check out the moonlight filling up the night sky
Girl, how many times that you me sat right here
It always seems to get too late
Something tells me that I oughta wait
So while I got my courage up, and my mind still clear
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
Sayin' all kinds of crazy things
Like you're the only girl for me
Oh, baby, it was meant to be
And it just feels right
Yeah, how I think about you all the time
I can't seem to keep you off my mind
Kissing ain't the only thing I wanna do to you tonight
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
You know those secrets I've been keeping
Way down deep inside of me
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
'Cause I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I know we've had a bit to drink
And I can take it to far
So, please forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart
I wanna tell you what I think
Out here underneath the stars
And I've been loving you for so long
I ain't sure where to start
I wanna tell you what I think
Underneath these stars
So, please, forgive me if the whiskey
Starts telling on my heart

Greener Pasture
Ooh oh ooh
I'm sittin' on the front porch, cigarette burnin'
Them makers in my coffee sure ain't workin'
I see the dirt from where his boots used to lay
Still phantom pains after a couple a days
And I wonder if he ever thought about turnin' around
Bet he's past El Paso by now
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture (ooh)
Bet he's rollin' through a new town, and she's fallin' for his accent
She don't know that he's a dust cloud, he's beautifully tragic
He stays for the night, but he's gone by the morning
Let him ruin your life like a Tennessee storm
And this shouldn't tear you up, break you down this bad
Lovin' something you never had
I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture
And all that ever mattered, livin' hard and livin' faster
Freedom was a dagger to a knife holder
There ain't no ever after, you're special, then you're shattered
Damn, he's got a way of leavin' his mark
Yeah, I was his Texaco, a stop just along the road
I should've known I ain't his last rodeo
I was his blue sky, but he's like the sunrise
A matter of time before he comes and he goes
'Til one day you'll wake up, he's packin' up his truck
And he don't even know what he's after
But cowboys always find a greener pasture (ooh)
But cowboys always find a greener pasture

Dooley's Farm
Old Dooley was raised Carolina
Got his schoolin' out in Vietnam
Tucks his hair up in a Pioneer seed cap
When he's bringing his cash crop in
Everybody said he's just a simpleton farmer
Plow a hundred acres out in Sugar Grove
Smilin' at you from an IH tractor
But there's a secret down in every row
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
Old Dooley's got a roadside farm stand
Sweet corn, tomatoes, and turnip greens
But if you ask to buy a jug of sorghum
He'll know exactly what you mean
He'll meet you in the back of the woods at midnight
Bring a lantern cause it's hard to find
He's got a strain that'll punch your lights out
Old Dooley's gonna blow your mind
In the Blue Ridge mountains
With the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco
Then they made moonshine
But there's something better
In the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
You can hide by day but the night will find you
They caught Dooley in the moonlight
Drug him down from the field to the state farm
To bust rocks on the roadside
Now everybody says I'm just a simpleton farmer
But they don't know that I'm an outlaw
Growing green must've ran in the family
Cause old Dooley is my grandpa
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines
They used to grow tobacco then they made moonshine
But there's something better in the back of the barn
Down on Dooley's farm
In the Blue Ridge mountains with the whispering pines

Your Drinkin', My Problem
Four a.m., stumbled to the bedroom again
'Cause I know where you're goin', you won't say where you've been
It was the bloodshot eyes that gave it away
Yeah, it's never my tab but I always pay
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Must be nice sleepin' 'til 11 o'clock like a rock
You lie to my face, not an ounce of shame in your walk
Oh, for the sake of my health, let's say that we're done
'Cause I feel like hell every time you get drunk
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Well, you can count me out for your next round
'Cause your livin' it up is bringin' me down
Your whiskey, my headache
Your good time, my heartbreak
Yeah, I'm stone cold sober, wakin' up hungover
Your party, my last call
Your first shot, my last straw
You're hittin' that bottle while I'm hittin' rock bottom
I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Yeah, I wish you'd quit makin' your drinkin' my problem
Yeah, my problem

Give It Time
I was going through the drawer at an old antique store
When a note on a page caught my eye
Words, they were sad, made my insides feel bad
Like it spoke from the man that I adore
He was moving on, he spent most of his nights gone
And I knew our love was ending
To this very day, I still get tears in my eyes
For the words that he never said
Give it time, write some letters
Give it time, you'll feel better
Soon I will fade from your mind
Give it time, no more sleepless nights
Give it time, you'll find the one that's right
You think that you still need me, give it time
And if you think that it won't last
You're probably just livin' in the past
And if you need someone to help you get through the night
Go out there, go ahead, find the light
And if you need some place to go, you're with me we'll go slow
To this very day, I still get tears in my eyes
For the words that he never said
Give it time, write some letters
Give it time, you'll feel better
Soon I will fade from your mind
Oh, give it time, no more sleepless nights
Give it time, you'll find the one that's right
You think that you still need me, just give it time

I Can't Love You Anymore
Shoulda known what I was getting in
Fallin' for a boy from Michigan
You love your mom like every Midwest kid
You like driving to Texas
You put up with all my exes
To deserve you, don't know what the hell I did
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
Bring me coffee every morning
You're fun even when you're boring
And you like me even when I've been a bitch
You watch me while I'm gettin' ready
You lighten up my heavy
You're so good lookin' it kinda makes me sick
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk you down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now, aye, aye
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You're the angel to my devil
The pot to my kettle
To some I might be an acquired taste
You tell me I'm your favorite person
Hey, what we've got is working
And the years have only made it more that way
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you anymore
I can't love you any more than I do now
You can try to talk me down
But I can say without a doubt
I can't love you any more than I do now
Heaven knows that I've attempted
Couldn't even put a dent in
I can't love you any more than I do now

Heart Like A Truck
I never stay in one place too long
A dirt road's singing me a siren song
I gotta find a field
I need to spin my wheels
I got a hankering for four wide tires
And I can't help it it's the way I'm wired
'Fore you get too close
Boy you need to know
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
There ain't no breaking when I throw it in drive
Don't always keep it in between the lines
If you're ready for a ride pedal down state of mind
Boy I tell you what
You better buckle up
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
Go on and see if you can knock off the dust yea
Shine it up revv it up and let it run yea
It gets a high riding off into the sun yea
I got a heart like a truck
It's been drug through the mud
Runs on dreams and gasoline
And that ole highway holds the key
It's got a lead foot down when it's leaving
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beating
A little bit of love is all that it's needing
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck
Go on and see if you can knock off the dust yea
Shine it up revv it up and let it run yea
It gets a high riding off into the sun yea
It gets a high riding off into the sun

Truth No. 2
You don't like the sound of the truth
Comin' from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well, baby that might be so
I might get to the end of my life
Find out everyone was lyin'
I don't think that I'm afraid anymore
Say that I would rather die tryin'
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
This time when he swung the bat
And I found myself layin' flat I wondered
What a way to spend a dime
What a way to use the time, ain't it baby?
I looked at my reflection in the window walkin' past
And I saw a stranger
Just so scared all the time it makes me one more reason
Why the world's dangerous
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips
You don't like the sound of the truth
Comin' from my mouth
You say that I lack the proof
Well, baby that might be so
Tell me what's wrong with havin' a little faith
In what you're feeling in your heart
Why must we be so afraid
And always so far apart?
Woh-oh
Swing me way down South
Sing me somethin' brave from your mouth
And I'll bring you
Pearls of water on my hips
And the love in my lips
All the love from my lips

Big Family
It's bunk beds and matching sheets
Sharin' the bathroom sink
Fist fightin' over window seats all the way to KOA
It's more cousins than we have friends
A piggyback pyramid to fit us all in
And squintin' through a Polaroid lens on Thanksgiving Day
We learned how to ration apple pie
And how to dirty dance when Aunt Tina had too much wine
It's all husbands and ex-wives and boyfriends and pink lines
And the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family
It's "Hurry up" and "Wait your turn" and
Eat it all even if it's burned
It don't take too long to learn that the world don't revolve around you
We're a picture frame patchwork
Roots tangled in the same dirt
Little baggage, little hard work
It's all worth its weight
In husbands and ex-wives and boyfriends and pink lines
And the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family, ooh
Big family
We're thick skinned and stubborn
'Til the day we're six feet under
It's the word of God according to who's preachin' in the living room
It's secrets and suppers
Lookin' more like your mother
All in a little house in a little town
But ain't nothing small about big family, ooh
Big family, yeah
Big family

Matches and Metaphors
It's raining at my house, is it raining at yours?
When it rains it pours, to hell with the metaphors.
I want you so bad I think I might die
I'm sorry I keep feeding you these lines, but
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
I wrote you a letter. I threw it in the trash.
Got it out lit it with a match.
I'm not gonna tell you how I feel,
It's overrated but damn, it's real
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
If you don't want me, that don't bother me at all.
Don't be upset if I don't answer when you call.
Maybe I can move on, but there was nothing to move on from.
My veins are on fire, babe my face is numb
I sure like your sounds
And if you were here,
I'd love to get you high, then lay down.
I want you hanging around.
I've been needing something good, baby-
Can I use you right now?
It's raining at my house, is it raining at yours

If Trouble Comes a Lookin’
What is there in Little Rock at the Hilton Double Tree
Just a woman far from home a thousand miles out to sea
She walks over to the window, pulls the curtain shut
Pours three fingers of whiskey in a flimsy plastic cup
Sits down on the bedspread, takes off her wedding ring
If she does something dark enough he might just set her free
It's her mother's mother's diamond in a shining golden band
Another woman who spent most her life loving the wrong man
If trouble comes a' lookin' she won't be hard to find
She's sitting in the hotel bar on her second glass of wine
She put a pretty dress on, wiped the tears out of her eyes
And if trouble comes a'lookin she won't be hard to find
Just two floors down is Brother John from Our Lady of Grace
He is older now but handsome still with such a lonely face
He picked a hotel off the Interstate where even God won't find him
Runs his fingers through the rosary and locks the door behind him
How was Christ so perfect, how on earth did he resist
The perfume on a woman's neck, the softness of her lips
He burned and burned for years with the fire of devotion
But some things are impossible to stop once they're in motion
If trouble comes a'lookin' he won't be hard to find
He's sitting in the hotel bar on his second glass of wine
Across the empty room he glances up to meet her eyes
And if trouble comes a lookin' he won't be hard to find
At quarter til the bartender will make the final call
She'll slip down off her stool and sway slowly down the hall
And he'll kiss her like she always wanted, back against the wall
And she'll step out of her dress looking like Eve before the fall
If trouble comes a lookin they won't be hard to find
They're tangled in each other's arms in room 229
They've never strayed this far into the shadows of the night
And if trouble comes a' lookin' they won't be hard to find
Not every infidelity is bound to end in shame
She'll smile one month later when a letter bears his name
Brother John has gone to France and Italy to travel
Where all of his ideas of God will happily unravel

Sober & Skinny
Oh-oh-oh
Wow-oh-oh-oh
I empty the fridge
You empty the bottle
We're stacking up a mountain of hard pills
We'll have to swallow
It's strange how we point
I've lost it one another
We both got different vices
And they lead us to each other
Cause you owe the drink and I over eat
We're under thinking everything
And every night we swear it's gonna change
But in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Write the checks that we can cash
Keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (hmm-mmm)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny (yeah, mmm)
You want being a shrink
While I think we should talk to one
Find a comfy couch and let out all the hurt
We've kept inside since we were young
That's so numb
Now we found ways to cover up
If we keep going out
We're going while we become
Cause in a perfect world
You get sober, I get skinny
We live all for more than pennies
Writing checks that we can cash
An keeping all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
We grow up and we get better
Things need fixing, we got plenty
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, oh, oh
It's easy to imagine, imagine
All our problems disappear like magic, magic
But even on this world
You're not sober, I'm not skinny
We scraping by old borrowed pennies
Writing checks that'll never cash
Breaking all our promises
We got faith, we got each other
Maybe we'll grow old together
Waking up by our happy ending
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh, oh)
But you get sober, I'll get skinny (oh)
When you get sober, I'll get skinny
You'll get sober, I'll get skinny
It's easy to imagine
It's easy to imagine
