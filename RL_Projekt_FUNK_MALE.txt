Uptight (Everything’s Alright)
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hanging on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can't buy
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, hahahahaha, yeah
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, way out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of...

Superfly 
Darkest of night with the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong; lotta things goin' on
The man of the hour has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Hard to understand what a hell of a man
This cat of the slum had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own but the man lived alone
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
The game he plays, he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' to get over
That's what he tryin' to do, y'all
Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Woo, Super Fly, huh, huh
The aim of his role was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream: what does it mean? He wouldn't know
"Can't be like the rest" is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out and there's no happiness
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Super Fly
Super Fly

Theme from Shaft 
Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
(Shaft)
Ya damn right
Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?
(Shaft)
Can you dig it?
Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?
(Shaft)
Right on
They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother...
(Shut your mouth)
I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft
(Then we can dig it)
He's a complicated man
But no one understands him but his woman
(John Shaft)

War 
(War, huh) Yeah!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, uhuh
(War, huh) Yeah!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Say it again, y'all!
(War, huh) Lookout!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me, awwwww!
War I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives
I said
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it again
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me!
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, awwww
War is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest, within the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
Awwww!
(War, huh) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) Oh-ohh yeah, huh
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), It's got one friend, that's the undertaker, awwww
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days
War can't give life, it can only take it away, awwww!
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Oh, absolutely nothing
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, woooo!
Peace, love and understanding
Tell me, is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows there's gotta be a better way, ooohhh
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) You tell me, say it, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Stand up and shout it (Nothing)

One, two
One, two, three, four, ow!
People movin' out, people movin' in
Why? Because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on
Well, the only person talkin' 'bout "Love thy brother"

Shooting rockets to the moon, kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on
So 'round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, said, nobody knows
Oh, Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
Just a ball of confusion
Oh yeah, that's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey
Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand, population out of hand
Suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war"
And the band played on
Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?

Higher Ground 
People keep on learning
Soldiers keep on warring
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long
Powers keep on lying
While your people keep on dying
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
'Til I reach my highest ground
Teachers keep on teaching
Preachers keep on preaching
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
Lovers keep on loving
Believers keep on believing
Sleepers just stop sleeping
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
'Til I reach my highest ground
Woo
'Til I reach my highest ground
No one's going to bring me down
Oh no
'Til I reach my highest ground
Don't you let nobody bring you down (They'll sho 'nuff try)
God is gonna show you highest ground
He's the only friend you'll have around
'Cause the rest of the world will bring you down

You don't have to do no solo-ing, brother
Just keep what you got
Don't turn it loose
'Cause it's a mother
When I count to four
I want everybody to lay off
Let the drummer go
When I count to four
I want you to come back in
I got to holler
I said, it's in my feet
Feels so sweet
It's in my shake, good God
About to work me to death

It’s Just Begun 
Watch me now
Feel the groove
Into something
Gonna make you move
Here we come
On the run
Don't know what
We're running from
Day or night
Black or white
Dance or sing
You gotta do your thing
You gotta do your thing
Peace will come
This world will rest
Once we have
Togetherness
Day or night
Dynomite
We had fun
But it's just begun
It's just begun
It's just begun
It's just begun (x 30)
