Ms. Jackson 
Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times


99 Problems
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward"
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rear-view mirror is the motherfucking law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
"Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are"
I ain't stepping out of shit, all my paper's legit
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?"
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!"
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clapping
And he and his boys gonna be yapping to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratching again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snapping em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail 'cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassing them
Trying to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothing sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, being a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
You crazy for this one, Rick
It's your boy


Straight Outta Compton 
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
Yo, Ren! (What's up?)
Tell 'em where you from!
Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
Damn, that shit was dope!


Lose Yourself
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it

Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship

Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide

And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Head home)
I, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

Gin and Juice 
(Ugh) Ha-ha-ha, I'm serious, nigga
One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
(Oh, man) Aye, baby, aye, baby, (shit) aye, baby
Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (But what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah

Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top

Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes

MAFIA 
Custom the things, custom the wings
I had to custom the vibe, custom the link up
Cover the back of the lab, front cover magazine
Cover your eyes, cuddled up, back of the V (Yeah)
Our chemistry, just like the trappers and fiends (Ooh)
Our misery really ain't nothin' to see
I gotta travel the V, I like to travel to heat (Ooh)
Bring out a bag of the weed
Did I tell you I got my own weed? I had a lot to achieve
Blew it out and I'm relieved, take it down, now you relieve
Rather you leave, then you go back out on me
Don't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least
You know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week
Movin' at rapid speed, like it's a track, we meet
We got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah
Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust
Like it thick with a bounce, we all in the count
Wine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with the wave
Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house
You come with two when it's late, know the brown one is my fav'
Then Mike Brown gon' walk you out (Walk you out)
Step by step, watch yourself
Cleaners got anything you might've left
I couldn't do none of this by myself
With mafia, they in the tuck
I gave you fifty to boost up your butt
I gave you the juice, you'd rather get buzzed
I tried to choose you, you'd rather go club
Know what to do, you rattled me up
Common denominator, we were steps from the diamond ages
Got a couple of vibrations
For the simulation, gotta re-up the hydration
Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked (Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall through this town today)
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas around)
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust (We still pourin' up for the niggas that can't be around today)
Mm, mm, woah-ah, mm-mm
Woah, mm-mm, mm-mm
Fuck shit up at the club (Ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Drop down
Run around, run around
Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked (Me and my niggas show up, you know it's goin' down)
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck (You know I'ma bring a parade if I fall through this town today)
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck (Ain't even gotta check, you know we hardest niggas around)
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust (We still pourin' up for the niggas that can't be around today)

JUST LIKE YOU 
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
It's strange the way the mind can wander, but also stop to gossip
And chat with memories that you and me aren't really fond of
Maybe you're out to find love, maybe you lost who you was
Maybе you're just like me and feel thе need to stay in your rut
'Cause if you left it, you might feel like you're no longer you
It's so impressive, the way the mind can play with the truth
It's interestin' that nobody can walk in your shoes
But still relate and feel the same, so in a way, guess we do
You ever think about what it would be like
If the clouds were gone and you could see light?
If the door was open, would you take flight
Or just close the curtains up and stay inside?
Take a walk with me, take a risk with me
I'm scared too and it gets so tempting
When you're so empty, to disown everything
You hold dearly when you know clearly
You been so buried in your own fairytale
The soul's tearin' bunch of holes in me
I relate to it, but in case you been
Thinkin' no one does, here's a great theory
Throw a Hail Mary, let ya mind fly
To the sun rise, could be so scary
Make your faith vary, feel the pain glaring
But the weight carried ain't in vain, hear me? (Hear me?)
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
So often I feel desperate, I think my heart's infected
How 'bout yours? How 'bout yours? How 'bout yours? I guess if
You feel the best when your life is hectic, you might be destined
To stay defective, so join the club, it ain't that hard to get in
It's hard to leave though, look at the guest list
I bet that your name is on it, don't believe me? Check it
See dead ends
In life we come to tend to raise some questions
Suggestion
Know that your feelings might give wrong directions (Infested)
Yeah, with the feeling of failure
Let it take over your body, it makes ya
Question the life that you have, situations
You might have enjoyed become nothin' but dated
Old and forgotten, but what would you say if
I told you that there was some hope we could make it?
I know what you're thinkin', I'm thinkin' it too
Could you really improve and be somethin' worth savin'?
See, I could pretend like I have all the answers
But none of us do, it's the reason we battle
Convincing yourself that you don't really matter's
Like feedin' a cancer and letting it travel
To every part of you, but what if we did
The unthinkable and cancel our trips?
What's achievable depends on the risk
So pick up your chin and listen to this
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you (You, you, you, you)
Yeah, everybody falls sometimes
Just remember that that's alright
It's the rainy days that give us love for the sun
And if it isn't, I guess I'll be fine believin' it does, oh yeah
Everybody falls sometimes
Just remember that that's alright
It's the lows in life that make you cherish the highs
And if it isn't, I guess I'll be fine believin' a lie (Ayy)
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you

South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastimе
'Nough pollution in the ends, I flew back yard 'cah I wanna see starlight
Eritrеan, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess
My empress, still gonna impress
I know 'dem man talk on the kid, but
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
'Nough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected
Any girl that I'm datin' knows, bags that I buy come filled with fifties
She a ten out of ten on a bad day, public affection, I tell her, "Come kiss me"
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
And put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies
I know them man talk on the kid but
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
'Nough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected
In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts in the ring
But don't help in the gym?
'Nough girls datin' their biggest haters
How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like, rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?
Yeah, yeah (Fly— Fly me to the moon)
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace
(Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter)
See her ex man, she got no taste, hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, servin' face (In other words, hold my hand)
Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer, bad, she toned and tan
Free my gang, 013's and 020's (Darlin' miss me)
Oh God knows, I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
In other words, I love you

Never give it up until the reaper come and slay me
Pull up with a Zelda and a Peach and a Daisy

Damn, Gravy, you so vicious (Ooh)

Judging from my vibe, you can feel it in my energy
Stacking paper steadily so I can live in luxury
Looking in the mirror, I thank God for what I'm about to be
You beefing with my enemy does not make you a friend of me
Girls so weird, stay clear, I'm living drama free
Never living comfortably, got a lot of goals to meet
My team is trying to eat so we grinding 'til our mental bleed
You tryna get a bag of weed? I'm tryna get a bag a week
Put it in my savings and invest in the right companies
My dream is like a child and I'm taking all the custody
Obstacles be slowing me, but that buffer molded me
So I take my time, 'cause I'm always where I'm suppose to be
Keep my niggas close to me 'cause I'm knowing they go for me
You can not get a hold of me? I'm probably in a solo meet
Always making moves, man that's how I keep my sanity
Yeah, it's my team's summer
Couple setbacks, bounce back and recover
The clique real small but we making big moves
And we headed to the top so we can get a better view like
I'ma catch a tan overseas while I'm out the country
Let me get some Hennessy while I'm chilling on the beach
I'ma count a couple G's, let the server bring receipts
Double checking my expenses, never messy, always neat
Never ever, thats how a hot girl do it
Number one stunner, icy girl with a Cuban
Cash money, mama that be dining in Bahamas
Eating Fettucini pasta with the scallops and the lobsters
Huh, I don't got no time for these hoes
Speaking on my name like I'm someone that they know
I'm the big cat bitch, yes these niggas love me
Is that Gucci on my feet? Shit, bitch it might be

Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
