Proud Mary 

You know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Then we're going to do the finish rough
This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling on the river
Listen to the story now
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling, rolling
Rolling yeah
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Rolling on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Ya know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
Ya know the big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on burning
And we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)
Said we're rolling (Rolling)
Rolling yeah (Rolling)
Rolling on the river (Rolling on the river)
Oh I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping
Worrying 'bout the way that things might have been
Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
We're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river
We're up
Do do do do do do do do do do
Alright
Oh I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
We're rolling, said we're rolling, we're rolling on the river

And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give
Big wheel keep on turning (Turning)
Proud Mary keep on burning (Burning)
And we're rolling, and we're rolling, and we're rolling on the river

Zombie 

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra

I Love Rock ’N Roll

I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he musta been about 17
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me, singin'
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
"That don't matter," he said, "'cause it's all the same"
Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
And next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me, singin'
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me
And we'll be movin' on and singin' that same old song
Yeah, with me, singin'
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby

Hit Me with Your Best Shot 

Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
That's okay, let's see how you do it
Put up your dukes, let's get down to it
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
You come on with it, come on, you don't fight fair
That's okay, see if I care
Knock me down, it's all in vain
I get right back on my feet again
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case
You better make sure you put me in my place
Hit me with your best shot
C'mon, hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Just a Girl
 
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand
'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights
Oh, I've had it up to here
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear
'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be
Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to here

Hey Hey

You've got to listen the guitars
Yes i can feel it in my blood
The taste of old good rock n roll
The alcohol
You got to lose your boring side
Let out your devil stay alive
Just try to prove this tasty sin
And let me in
Hey hey
The motherfuckers want to turn it off
Hey hey
But there is nothing to make us stop
Hey hey
Turn loud the music baby
And i will bring this down
You got to lose your own control
Just come with me in ecstasy
Feel the vibration in your bones
Don’t be strong as stone
You got to kiss my flaming soul
Forget your proud take off your clothes
Just keep on dancing to the beat
Scream, baby, scream 

Adrenaline

Feel the adrenaline chasing through your veins
Gotta love the attention
I wanna feel the energy rising
I wanna feel this bass drum pounding
Through your skin, you take to the night
Like thunder and lightning
Let's own this night
Just you and me, boy
Let me hear you scream
Hey...
Hey...
I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet
Take take take me anywhere you want me
I wanna feel you play
With my heart
Grasp anything you want
I love to feel this pain
Hey...
Ooh...
I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You lookеd over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet
I can't hеlp but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet!
I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet
I can't help but feel...
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard!
At your feet

Because the Night
 
Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust

Mayhem 

He said he didn’t even hear trains let alone the few words
The ladies maybe sayin’ about him
She freaks and tells her closest friend that she’ll never love again
But she’ll never, no not ever
Live without him
Wouldn’t believe it, if you seen it
Oh, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta Mayhem, woh oh oh yeah
She said he didn’t mean a thing so she threw her diamond ring
Out the window of a black cab in Camden
He couldn’t take it, what she did
So he threw a hissy fit and he took it out on anyone at random
Wouldn’t believe it, if you seen it
Oh, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta Mayhem, woh oh oh yeah
Dinning sound, lights spinning round, some mothers’ son
Gotta fight or got to run run run run
Run run run run run
Ten pints and then he starts a fight and he lands himself a night
In a cell wearing grey pants and bruises
Twelve mates bangin’ on the door, oh the back up vans galore
Never saw such a street full of losers

Drugstore Rock and Roll 

Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll

Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
Drugstore on the corner of main
That's where you find all the bebop gang
The girls fill the jukebox and then demand
The jitterbug hand-in-hand
The boys have crew-cuts under their hats
The girls have leather sweaters, real cool cats
They're always together happy an' hep
Jumpin' to a rock 'n' roll step
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man

Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
The records have a slow beat, a fast beat too
As long as they're rockin' any beat will do
Kittens gettin' groovy all over the floor
And the cats are cryin' for more
Take time out for a soda pop
Dig a new record with a lot of bop
Ice cream cones and banana split
Ten jumps ahead of a fit
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll

Stay High 

I already feel like doing it again, honey
'Cause once you know, then you know
And you don't wanna go
Back to wherever it is that you come from, yeah
I just want to stay high with you
'Cause where I come from
Everybody frowns and walks around
With that ugly thing on their face
And where I come from
We work hard and grind and hustle all day
(Yes, we do)
There comes a time, there comes a time
At night where we get to play
And we smile and laugh and jump and clap
And yell and holler and just feel great
I just want to stay high with you
With you, with you, baby
So don't question my state of mind
I'm doing wonderful, just fine, thank you
(Thank you)
Everything is everything and everything is beautiful
(How did you get like that?)
See, all I do is keep it cool and don't worry 'bout what everyone is doing
I already feel like doing it again, honey
I just want to stay high
I just want to stay high
I just want to stay high with you

Still into You 

Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time, I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)
I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you

Sk8er Boi 

He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
I see the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'm with the skater boy (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I said, "See you later, boy" (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be backstage after the show (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be at our studio (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Singin' the song we wrote (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
About a girl you used to know (Yeah-yeah-yeah)

Heads Will Roll 

Off with your head
Dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor
Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The river's all wet
You're all chrome
Dripping with alchemy
Shiver, stop shivering
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
The men cry out, the girls cry out

Off, off with your head
Dance, dance 'til you're dead (dead)
Heads will roll

On the floor
Looking glass
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies

Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Clock is ticking while I'm killing time
Spinning all around
Nothing else that you can do to turn it back
Wicked partnership in this crime
Ripping off the best
Condescending smile
Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth
Go on, tease me
Clock is ticking while I'm stealing time
Can't you turn it back?
Stop the cycle, set it free and run away
Silent sneaking along my path
Rugged the road but we
Feel it like we're flyin'
(Feel it like we're flyin'...)
Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth
Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth...

Kiss Me Deadly 

I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid
I got in a fight
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
Late for my job
And the traffic was bad
Had to borrow ten bucks from my old man
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
I went to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story
It'd be alright
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me deadly
Had a few beers
Getting high
Sitting, watching the time go by
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
Nothing to eat and no TV
Looking in the mirror
Don't get it for me
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me
Oh, yeah
You know I like dancing with you
Dancing with you
C'mon
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me
C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me
C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me deadly

Seether 

Ow!
Seether is neither loose nor tight
Seether is neither black nor white
I tried to keep her on a short leash
I tried to calm her down
I tried to ram her into the ground, yeah
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Seether is neither big nor small
Seether is the center of it all
I tried to rock her in my cradle
I tried to knock her out
I tried to cram her back in my mouth, yeah
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Keep her down, boiling water
Keep her down, what a lovely daughter
Oh, she is not born like other girls
But I know how to conceive her
Oh, she may not look like other girls
But she's a snarl-toothed seether, seether!
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Seether
Can't fight the seether

Lucky Lips 

When I was just a little girl with long and silky curls
My mama told me: "Honey, you got more than other girls!
Now you may not be good looking, but you'll soon wear diamond clips
And you'll never have to worry, 'cause you've got lucky lips!"
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true!
I don't need a four-leave clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!
(With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!)
I never get heartbroken, no, I never get the blues
And if I play the game of love, I know I just can't lose
When they spin that wheel of fortune, all I do is kiss my chips
And I know I'm picked a winner, 'cause I've got lucky lips!
And I know I'm bound to win, yeah, 'cos I've got lucky lips!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true!
I don't need a four-leave clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!

When Will I Be Loved 

I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?

I Can’t Make You Love Me 

Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

Fade Into You 

I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you when I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colored your eyes with what's not there
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew
