Anti-Hero
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman?
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving and life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it
And then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from hell!"
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me
Hi
Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees
It's me
Hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Time)
Everybody agrees
(Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero 

Grapefruit
Countin' while I run the tap
I'm on my knees
Chokin' on my hands all night
In my sleep
Countin' all the calories
Now get 'em up
Body positivity
Help me out
The swans of ballet
Their skin and their bones, that's not me
I'd die for my love though, break
Break 'til I wither away
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
Sweet girl, you're so disciplined
Now keep it down
I don't like my measurements
Won't make a sound
Diana, how she guards the clock (The clock)
She's in control (Control)
Now why is everyone in shock? (In shock)
You let her go
The swans of ballet ('Llet)
Their skin and their bones, that's not me (Me)
I'd die for my love though, break (Break)
Break 'til I wither away
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in

How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
When I'm hurtin', every time I have a bad day
Then everyone gets lost
But I'm learnin' every time I feel out of place
That you are all I've got, oh
One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in (Oh)
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me

Million Dollar Baby
She's a miracle
Diamonds
She turns tears to diamonds, woah
Trying to find that silver lining, woah
And once in a while
I'll go walkin' in the twilight
Counting down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine
I'm hiding in the shadows
Praying that she'll break free
In the dark of the night
She got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby
Nobody can explain it
She's a miracle

Just coming back to life now, woah
And one in a while
I'll go walkin' in the twilight
Counting down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine

Praying that she'll break free

She got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby
Nobody can explain it

SNAP
It's 4 am
I can't turn my head off
Wishin' these memories would fade
They never do
Turns out people lie
They say, "Just snap your fingers"
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you
I just need time
Snapping one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snapping three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
I'm writing a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left?
I'm losing count
Since June twenty-second
My heart's been on fire
I was spending my nights in the rain
Tryna put it out
So I'm snapping one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snapping three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
'Cause I might snap
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
And if one more person says, "You should get over it"
Oh, I might stop talking to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talking to people before I snap
Snapping one, two
Where are you? (Where are you?)
You're still in my heart (Still in my heart)
Snapping three, four
Don't need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Snap)

Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Snap)
Get out of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-ooh

Bam Bam
You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now (Mmm)
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast
Yeah, that's just life, baby

It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now
I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around

Boyfriend
I can't believe we're finally alone
I can't believe I almost went home
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
And he's not with you (Hm, hm, hm, hm)
The universe must have divined this
What am I gonna do?
Not grab your wrist?
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend
I don't need to tell you twice
All the ways he can't suffice
If I could give you some advice
I would leave with me tonight
The universe must have divined this
Mm, mm, mm
Ladies first, baby, I insist
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could be a better boyfriend
I never would have left you alone
Here on your own
Glued to your phone
Never would have left you alone
For someone else to take you home
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus you know my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit

Not Another Rockstar
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Pinky promised I was quittin'
Pinky promised that I wouldn't love somebody if they didn't
I'm a girl with big ambitions, but did I listen?
No, no, no, no
They're tortured and I wouldn't understand it
Plus they got a lot of unexamined father/son baggage
They don't wanna talk about it, is that a challenge?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsessive and I sign up, sign up
Ooh
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
He's been a player since the cradle
Aren't I lucky 'cause he could have chosen any girl to fuck with?
And he chose me, so I guess I should be grateful
No, no, no, no
Hmm, funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsessive and I sign up, sign up
Where's the pen? Where's the line?
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Ooh, not another rockstar
Ooh, not another rockstar
Glad that I got out before it got dark
You could be a better person, no, it's not hard
If there was a moment in this where you saw it goin' different, tell me what part
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar" 

Nonsense
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to don't leave me alone
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen now you got me feelin' thrown
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like bleh, blah, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song I wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill I must have lost it
I don't even know I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking, all around clock
I'm talking hope nobody knocks
I'm talking opposite of soft
I'm talking wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like blah, blah, bleh, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill I musta lost it
I don't even know I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking
I'm talking
I'm talking
This song catchier than chicken poxes
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning thought I'd write a pop hit
How quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz?

uh oh
Feel your eyes watchin' me
So I'm movin' on him just so you can see
Told you I was gonna get you right back
Oh, you don't really like that? (Oh)
I'm yours again (Oh) when you walk away (Oh)
You know if you leave, I ain't gonna stay (Oh-oh-oh)
When I'm doin' good, you get me off track (Oh)
And I guess I kinda like that (Oh)
You make me really, really good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missin'
Seven texts and two missed calls
Know I can't ignore 'em all
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied
Uh, uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb
Uh-oh, now we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
Roll your eyes, like you do
Should have known it's always the same with you
Tryin' not to feel our connection
But, oh my god, it's kinda temptin'
You said, "Can we leave now?" (Oh)
I don't think we should (Oh)
Through the back door (Oh)
That won't end good (Oh)
How 'bout my place?
Shit, you know I would (Oh)
Then I follow you out
Hope nobody looks
You make me really, really good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missin'
Seven texts and two missed calls
Make you wait before I fall
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied
Uh, uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb
Uh-oh, now we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
(Again, again)
Again, again
(Again, again)
Again, again 

W.I.T.C.H.
Rumor on the street is that her apples are delicious
The jury said she's charming but her exes say she's wicked
I swear to god I saw her howling at the sky
She ain't out to get you but she's better on your side
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself
Villainous kitty queen, she's got tricks up her sleeve
And I got a few up mine
She said, am I bad to the bone cause I get what I want
Mama said it ain't no crime
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Come out and play, it's fun in the dark
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge
Baby don't run, you're breaking my heart
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, what a woman, woman, yeah
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself 

TV
I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade
Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
And I don't get along with anyone
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem

How Could You
You said you were sober
So I let you come over
Your words pulled me closer
But your words fuck me over
I kept on denyin'
So you kept on tryin'
You went too far for closure
Too far fucked me over
I could just lie here, say, "It's okay"
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
Set it on fire and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you? How could you?
Oh, I more than regret you
You've convinced yourself I let you
The better version of me never met you
Never let you in my bedroom
Oh, all those shitty lines and crooked blinds
And cheap red wine stains
Threaten suicide to change my mind
And keep me afraid
You want me to lie here, and say, "It's okay"
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
Set it on fire and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you? How could you?
I once loved a liar
'Cause he knew my name
Would rewrite the story
And make me to blame
How could you?

October Passed Me By
I keep the letters that you wrote
In a secret place
Every now and then I go
Down memory lane
October passed me by
Just like any month
But I still think of the times
You took the breath out of my lungs
You don't have to run
Yeah, I got bitter when you got cold
Could you really blame me though
'Cause I'm still tied up when you go
You know this song is about you
Who else could it be?
You were the first to make me
Feel like I was me
Just a memory
It wasn't all good, yeah
It wasn't all pretty
Lost our grip
While tryna go steady
Holding on to you like maybe
One day we'll meet
I met you at the wrong time
Didn't wanna see
I was busy with the stars
You were looking at me
For better or for worse
I don't know
But for what it's worth
I made you my whole world
I made you my whole world
Screaming at the top of my lungs, "I love you my girl"
Always in the back of my mind
You'll be my girl 

Norman Fucking Rockwell
Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said, "I love you"
You're fun and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood
Ah-ah
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you?
You-oh-oh
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue
You make me blue
Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue 

Dance Monkey
They say, "Oh my God, I see the way you shine
Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine"
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So they say
"Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"
They say
"Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again"
I said, "Oh my God, I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes"
Just like a monkey, I've been dancin' my whole life
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry

All again"

Stray
I wanna write a song
One that can explain my loss
I wanna write a song
That you can hear and
Know how my heart yearns
And how my insides churn
And how my cheeks burn
From the weekly storm
And how my face turns
Before you return to the wall
And then down the floor
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I will stray
I gotta write a song
But I wanna feel my words
And I keep getting it all wrong
Think it out, write it out, rip it out
Throw it all to the wall
And I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
But I keep only seeing rain
I'll keep saying no
But you'll find your way into my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I'll stray
Wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna feel the way I used to

7 Rings
Yeah
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing
My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossy
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all 'em"
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms"
My smile is beamin'
My skin is gleamin'
The way it shine
I know you've seen it
You've seen it
I bought a crib
Just for the closet
Both his and hers
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Baby
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
Oh, yeah
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yep
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black Card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag
But I be like, "Put it in the bag"
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah
Shoot
Go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop
Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot
Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Oh, yeah, yeah
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah 

The First One
I know I shouldn't say what I'm 'bout to say
'Cause it's never okay to go and bring your exes up
No matter what
My second and my third, I hate they got the worst of me
They don't deserve the way that I was treating them
I'd lead them on
When I knew what I was doing
I was stupid, I was ruined, I was healing
But the healing never happened
And I'm sorry that I did you wrong
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah
I just can't forget some of the words he said
The memories in my bed keep coming back again
Like daggers in my mind, yeah
They draw blood all night, yeah
Yeah, I know what I've been doing
Running through 'em just to try and catch a feeling
But the feeling never happened
And I'm sorry that I did you wrong
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
No, there ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
Promise that it kills
Every time you send
A picture from a place
You and I used to go
I hope you know
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
No, there ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
No, there ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
(No, there ain't nothing I can do about it) Yeah, yeah 


Runaway
I was listening to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands, down
I had a dream I was seven
Climbing my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waiting, impatient, for me, down
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you
And for a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, down
And all this time I have been lying
Oh, lying in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
La di da!
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
But I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
I can't take it anymore 

Bad Guy
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along
With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type

I'm only good at being bad
Bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean
I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy 

Want You In My Room
When all the lights out (Hey), where you're going?
I keep a window, for you, it's always open
I'm like a lighthouse, I'm a reminder of where you're going
I'm in your head now, from every second now
Is your love growing?
Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over

I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby, don't you want me, too?
When no one loves you like they really mean it
I got you covered, under covers
Can you feel it?
Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
