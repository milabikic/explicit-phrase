Anti-Hero
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman?
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving and life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it
And then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from hell!"
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me
Hi
Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees
It's me
Hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Time)
Everybody agrees
(Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero 

Grapefruit
Countin' while I run the tap
I'm on my knees
Chokin' on my hands all night
In my sleep
Countin' all the calories
Now get 'em up
Body positivity
Help me out
The swans of ballet
Their skin and their bones, that's not me
I'd die for my love though, break
Break 'til I wither away
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
Sweet girl, you're so disciplined
Now keep it down
I don't like my measurements
Won't make a sound
Diana, how she guards the clock (The clock)
She's in control (Control)
Now why is everyone in shock? (In shock)
You let her go
The swans of ballet ('Llet)
Their skin and their bones, that's not me (Me)
I'd die for my love though, break (Break)
Break 'til I wither away
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in

How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
When I'm hurtin', every time I have a bad day
Then everyone gets lost
But I'm learnin' every time I feel out of place
That you are all I've got, oh
One, two, grapefruit
How am I back here again?
Three, four, lose more
I know my mirrors are lyin'
Five, six, hate this
Take back the body I'm in (Oh)
What I see is not me
What I see is not me
One, two, grapefruit
Wish I could change overnight
Three, four, lose more
Kill my obsession, please die
Five, six, hate this
How am I still in this fight?
What I see is not me

Million Dollar Baby
She's a miracle
Diamonds
She turns tears to diamonds, woah
Trying to find that silver lining, woah
And once in a while
I'll go walkin' in the twilight
Counting down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine
I'm hiding in the shadows
Praying that she'll break free
In the dark of the night
She got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby
Nobody can explain it
She's a miracle

Just coming back to life now, woah
And one in a while
I'll go walkin' in the twilight
Counting down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine

Praying that she'll break free

She got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby
Nobody can explain it

SNAP
It's 4 am
I can't turn my head off
Wishin' these memories would fade
They never do
Turns out people lie
They say, "Just snap your fingers"
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you
I just need time
Snapping one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snapping three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
I'm writing a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left?
I'm losing count
Since June twenty-second
My heart's been on fire
I was spending my nights in the rain
Tryna put it out
So I'm snapping one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snapping three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
'Cause I might snap
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
And if one more person says, "You should get over it"
Oh, I might stop talking to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talking to people before I snap
Snapping one, two
Where are you? (Where are you?)
You're still in my heart (Still in my heart)
Snapping three, four
Don't need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap
Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Snap)

Oh-oh-oh-ooh (Snap)
Get out of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-ooh

Bam Bam
You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now (Mmm)
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast
Yeah, that's just life, baby

It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now
I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around

Boyfriend
I can't believe we're finally alone
I can't believe I almost went home
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
And he's not with you (Hm, hm, hm, hm)
The universe must have divined this
What am I gonna do?
Not grab your wrist?
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend
I don't need to tell you twice
All the ways he can't suffice
If I could give you some advice
I would leave with me tonight
The universe must have divined this
Mm, mm, mm
Ladies first, baby, I insist
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could be a better boyfriend
I never would have left you alone
Here on your own
Glued to your phone
Never would have left you alone
For someone else to take you home
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus you know my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit

Not Another Rockstar
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Pinky promised I was quittin'
Pinky promised that I wouldn't love somebody if they didn't
I'm a girl with big ambitions, but did I listen?
No, no, no, no
They're tortured and I wouldn't understand it
Plus they got a lot of unexamined father/son baggage
They don't wanna talk about it, is that a challenge?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsessive and I sign up, sign up
Ooh
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
He's been a player since the cradle
Aren't I lucky 'cause he could have chosen any girl to fuck with?
And he chose me, so I guess I should be grateful
No, no, no, no
Hmm, funny I could pick 'em in a line up, line up
Pretty certain I could do it with my eyes shut, eyes shut
A little self-obsessive and I sign up, sign up
Where's the pen? Where's the line?
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Ooh, not another rockstar
Ooh, not another rockstar
Glad that I got out before it got dark
You could be a better person, no, it's not hard
If there was a moment in this where you saw it goin' different, tell me what part
Hand me down jewels and your dirty blonde hair
I think "You're so cool and different," and then
The law pulls up and you won't get in the car
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar"
Talk about me, make it all about you
Caught you rippin' your jeans, and that's when I knew
You'd leave me dead if it'd set you apart
And I'm like, "Oh, goddamn, not another rockstar" 

Nonsense
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to don't leave me alone
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen now you got me feelin' thrown
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like bleh, blah, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song I wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill I must have lost it
I don't even know I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking, I'm talking, I'm talking, all around clock
I'm talking hope nobody knocks
I'm talking opposite of soft
I'm talking wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
But I can't help myself
When you get close to me
Baby my tongue goes numb
Sounds like blah, blah, bleh, bleh
I don't want no one else
Baby I'm in too deep
Here's a lil song wrote
It's about you and me
I'll be honest
Lookin' at u got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
When you got your arms around me
Ooh it feels so good I had to hit the octave
I think I got an ex but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill I musta lost it
I don't even know I'm talking nonsense
I'm talking
I'm talking
I'm talking
This song catchier than chicken poxes
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning thought I'd write a pop hit
How quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz?

uh oh
Feel your eyes watchin' me
So I'm movin' on him just so you can see
Told you I was gonna get you right back
Oh, you don't really like that? (Oh)
I'm yours again (Oh) when you walk away (Oh)
You know if you leave, I ain't gonna stay (Oh-oh-oh)
When I'm doin' good, you get me off track (Oh)
And I guess I kinda like that (Oh)
You make me really, really good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missin'
Seven texts and two missed calls
Know I can't ignore 'em all
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied
Uh, uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb
Uh-oh, now we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
Roll your eyes, like you do
Should have known it's always the same with you
Tryin' not to feel our connection
But, oh my god, it's kinda temptin'
You said, "Can we leave now?" (Oh)
I don't think we should (Oh)
Through the back door (Oh)
That won't end good (Oh)
How 'bout my place?
Shit, you know I would (Oh)
Then I follow you out
Hope nobody looks
You make me really, really good at makin' bad decisions
All my friends know where to look every time I go missin'
Seven texts and two missed calls
Make you wait before I fall
Said that I'm gonna be sleepin' at mine
I lied
Uh, uh-oh, I couldn't help myself
I'm almost at your house again, again (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh, I'm one foot in the door
My clothes are on your floor again, again
I get a little drunk and it's all I want
Tomorrow I'll be sick, but tonight I'm numb
Uh-oh, now we can just pretend
We won't do it again, again, again
(Again, again)
Again, again
(Again, again)
Again, again 

W.I.T.C.H.
Rumor on the street is that her apples are delicious
The jury said she's charming but her exes say she's wicked
I swear to god I saw her howling at the sky
She ain't out to get you but she's better on your side
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself
Villainous kitty queen, she's got tricks up her sleeve
And I got a few up mine
She said, am I bad to the bone cause I get what I want
Mama said it ain't no crime
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Come out and play, it's fun in the dark
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge
Baby don't run, you're breaking my heart
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, what a woman, woman, yeah
And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself 

TV
I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade
Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
And I don't get along with anyone
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem

How Could You
You said you were sober
So I let you come over
Your words pulled me closer
But your words fuck me over
I kept on denyin'
So you kept on tryin'
You went too far for closure
Too far fucked me over
I could just lie here, say, "It's okay"
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
Set it on fire and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you? How could you?
Oh, I more than regret you
You've convinced yourself I let you
The better version of me never met you
Never let you in my bedroom
Oh, all those shitty lines and crooked blinds
And cheap red wine stains
Threaten suicide to change my mind
And keep me afraid
You want me to lie here, and say, "It's okay"
When I wanna rip all the doors off this place
Set it on fire and just walk away
So I can feel anything else but this weight
'Cause I let you in when I needed space
And you crossed a line when I pushed you away
How could you? How could you?
I once loved a liar
'Cause he knew my name
Would rewrite the story
And make me to blame
How could you?

October Passed Me By
I keep the letters that you wrote
In a secret place
Every now and then I go
Down memory lane
October passed me by
Just like any month
But I still think of the times
You took the breath out of my lungs
You don't have to run
Yeah, I got bitter when you got cold
Could you really blame me though
'Cause I'm still tied up when you go
You know this song is about you
Who else could it be?
You were the first to make me
Feel like I was me
Just a memory
It wasn't all good, yeah
It wasn't all pretty
Lost our grip
While tryna go steady
Holding on to you like maybe
One day we'll meet
I met you at the wrong time
Didn't wanna see
I was busy with the stars
You were looking at me
For better or for worse
I don't know
But for what it's worth
I made you my whole world
I made you my whole world
Screaming at the top of my lungs, "I love you my girl"
Always in the back of my mind
You'll be my girl 

Norman Fucking Rockwell
Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said, "I love you"
You're fun and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood
Ah-ah
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you?
You-oh-oh
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue
You make me blue
Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue 

Dance Monkey
They say, "Oh my God, I see the way you shine
Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine"
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Stray
I wanna write a song
One that can explain my loss
I wanna write a song
That you can hear and
Know how my heart yearns
And how my insides churn
And how my cheeks burn
From the weekly storm
And how my face turns
Before you return to the wall
And then down the floor
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I will stray
I gotta write a song
But I wanna feel my words
And I keep getting it all wrong
Think it out, write it out, rip it out
Throw it all to the wall
And I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
But I keep only seeing rain
I'll keep saying no
But you'll find your way into my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I
I keep only seeing rain
I will say no
But you keep crawling in my brain
I wanna get lost, run away
In the dark is where I'll stray
Wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna move the way I used to groove
I wanna feel the way I used to
I wanna feel the way I used to

7 Rings
Yeah
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing
My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossy
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'
You like my hair?

Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all 'em"
Happiness is the same price as "red-bottoms"
My smile is beamin'
My skin is gleamin'
The way it shine

Black Card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag
But I be like, "Put it in the bag"
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah
Shoot
Go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop
Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot
Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set

The First One
I know I shouldn't say what I'm 'bout to say
'Cause it's never okay to go and bring your exes up
No matter what
My second and my third, I hate they got the worst of me
They don't deserve the way that I was treating them
I'd lead them on
When I knew what I was doing
I was stupid, I was ruined, I was healing
But the healing never happened
And I'm sorry that I did you wrong
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah
I just can't forget some of the words he said
The memories in my bed keep coming back again
Like daggers in my mind, yeah
They draw blood all night, yeah
Yeah, I know what I've been doing
Running through 'em just to try and catch a feeling
But the feeling never happened
And I'm sorry that I did you wrong
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
No, there ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah
Promise that it kills
Every time you send
A picture from a place
You and I used to go
I hope you know
To all the ones I ever loved
Never let you in enough
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
To all the ones I ever hurt
Always knew it wouldn't work
Not your fault I gave too much
To the first one, to the first one
There ain't nothing I can do about it, yeah, yeah

Runaway
I was listening to the ocean
I saw a face in the sand
But when I picked it up
Then it vanished away from my hands, down
I had a dream I was seven
Climbing my way in a tree
I saw a piece of heaven
Waiting, impatient, for me, down
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
I was painting a picture
The picture was a painting of you
And for a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true, down
And all this time I have been lying
Oh, lying in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
La di da!
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
Nobody knows, nobody knows
And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore
But I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I kept running for a soft place to fall
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
Now take me home, home where I belong
I can't take it anymore 

Bad Guy
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you

What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?

I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy

Giant
I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw the pills on your table
For your unrequited love
Oh, I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us
I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I am a giant (Oh)

Don't hide your emotion
You can throw down your guard
And freed from the notion
We can be who we are
Oh, you taught me something, yeah
That freedom is ours
It was you who taught me living is
Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness
I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see

If I Can't Have You
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room (Yeah)
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know, that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it

Is it wrong for me to not want half
I want all of you, all the strings attached
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance

Maniac
You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead so
You show up at my home all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause
People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated
Me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?
You maniac

Call me crying in the dark
Now you're breaking my heart
So I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face
While you beg me to stay, well
People like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that
And you know that
So you should turn back
To your rat pack

Listen to yourself, think you need to get some help
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy
And drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher
A psychopath
Then tell them you hate me and dated

Old Me
Shout out to the old me
And everything he showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
Never a night alone
Anywhere you wanna go
Woke up in the morning
Wearing someone else's clothes
Pictures in my phone
With people I don't know
Woke up in the morning
How the hell'd I make it home?
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
But I wondered if I ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never should've done
I would do it over now
I'd do it over
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me
Another round, here we go
Going in, blow for blow
Look into the mirror, take the punches that I throw
I'm constantly reminded
Of all the compromises
By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
But I wondered if I ever, if I'd ever get enough
And I did some shit I never shoulda done
I would do it over now
I'd do it over
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me
Devil at my door
Got me knocking, knocking, knocking
On the other side
Ashes on the floor
But I'm walking, walking, walking
Out of here alive
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Glad you didn't listen when the world was tryna slow me
No one could control me
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me
And everything you showed me
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me, ay, ay

Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"

Celestial
You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again
I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're going down
And I know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial
You see the light shinin' through the rain
A thousand colors in the brighter shade
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's a silver lining that surrounds the gray
When I get lost will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're going down
Know your arms are reaching out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Celestial, ohh
We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things
When we notice that's what really matters is
Make tonight go on and on and on
You make me feel
(We were made to be
Nothing more than this
Finding magic in all the smallest things)
You make me feel
(When we notice that's what really matters is)

Forget Me
Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow, it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me dead
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe
Oh, I
Even after all, it still wrecks me
To find out you knew how to forget me
Even after all this time
Days ache and nights are grey
My heart is still your place, babe
Guess I still feel the same
Know you can't stand my face
Some scars you can't erase, babe
Guess you still feel the same
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe

Loser
Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I just might get a little too drunk so I won't think about us
I don't think about what we could have been
And I stay up like three or four nights so I won't dream about us
Wake up with no luck
I just can't win
I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
It hurts whenever someone says her name (Someone says her name)

Yeah, and now I keep lying to myself when she's just joking probably
(She's joking probably)
She'll probably call me and we'll be us again

How Do I Say Goodbye
Early morning
There's a message on my phone
It's my mother saying, "Darling, please come home"
I fear the worst
But how could you leave us all behind?
There's so much to say but there's so little time
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
When I couldn't, you always saw the best in me
Right or wrong, you were always on my side
But I'm scared of what life without you's like
And I saw the way she looked into your eyes
And I promise if you go, I will make sure she's alright
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
And there's no way you could ever let me down
Gonna steal some time and start again
You'll always be my closest friend
And someday we are gonna make it out
Just hold the light, just hold the light
So how do I say goodbye
To someone who's been with me for my whole damn life?
You gave me my name and the colour of your eyes
I see your face when I look at mine
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?
So how do I, how do I, how do I say goodbye?

The Best Is Yet To Come
There's nothing you could tell me
That would make me walk away
'Cause in my eyes you're perfect
And there's nothing I would change
I've seen you on your best days
And I'll see you on your worst, my love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know the last few years
Have been a test of character
Remind ourselves on darker days
The best is yet to come
In life, I've made a few mistakes
But you were never one, my love
And I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be here if you need love, if you need strength
Forever by your side until the end
With me, you really don't have to pretend
It's all okay, if you're not okay
'Cause I know, sometimes it feels just like the world is ending
Those days where nothing seems to go your way
Well, with me, you really don't have to pretend that
It's all okay, if you're not okay
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love
I'll be there, my love

One Life
It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I gotta do
To be making a change now, the moment of truth
Why am I feeling so nervous when
Things are going so perfect ten?
But I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to her lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holding me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
The sun will reappear, burning auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass knoll was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way of falling deeper in you
Why was I feeling nervous when
Things were going so perfect ten?
And now I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be

Late Night Talking
Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you

Bad Habit
I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
What you, ooh, uh, what'd you do?
Made a move, could've made a move
If I knew I'd be with you
Is it too late to pursue?
I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear
Never gave me time of day, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I think are sure, yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me (I wish I knew)
I wish I knew (Oh), I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (Yeah), I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)

Please say to me (Please, just say to me)
If you still want it
I wish you wouldn't play with me
I wanna know (I wanna know)
Uh, can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?
Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
Now you're not too good for me, my dear
Funny you come back to me, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew (Wish I knew), I wish I knew you wanted me (Oh)
You can't surprise a Gemini (I wish I knew)
I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed (I wish I knew you wanted me)
Now that you're back, I can't decide (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied and
I turn it on and make it rowdy
Then carry on, but I'm not hidin'
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
It's biscuits, it's gravy, babe

'Cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
Let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
Go stupid, go crazy, babe
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end
You'll miss me, don't beg me, babe

Glimpse Of Us
She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she is so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working
So what can I do?
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
And find me again
When you're out of sight
In my mind
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of
The way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
And that's where I find
A glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinking of

Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping I'll find
A glimpse of us
