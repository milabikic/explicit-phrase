Secretary 
It's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
Girls, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
She takes the time to listen
To what he has to say
While all you do is nag him
A thousand times a day
Her hair is always pretty
And her clothes are always stylish
But you greet him with your hair in rollers
And that's outdated and so childish
Oh, it's very ordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
We make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life
Are you there when he needs you?
Are your favors less than cute?
And when he tries to love you
Do you find something else to do?
Now the ordinary girl may not wear pearls
Or diamonds on each hand
Oh, but like the secretary, wooh
She knows how to please her man
Oh, it's not extraordinary for the secretary
To take a man away from his wife
You see, we make it necessary for the secretary
To put a little joy in his life, hey, hey
You see, life's a bowl of cherries
For all the secretaries, hey, hey
Oh, it's very ordinary, it's not extraordinary
Girls, don't be contrary or you'll make it necessary
Your life can be so merry just like the secretary
Life's a bowl of cherries

I gave my love, don't you see?
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?
Loving you, somehow I feel cheated

Used me, abused me
Knocked down and walked all over me
Now you've got yours, what about me?
I gave my love, don't you see?

Now I got you, you don't care for me
Here I am, wasting time
I fool myself thinking I do it right
So, ok! It's enough
Don't wanna play your game no more
(I won't play your game no more)
I´m not gonna beg you to treat me carefully
'Cause it's too late to stay with me
I´m not gonna beg you to treat me tenderly
If you don't know what love is
Don't wanna wake up tomorrow morning and find out that there's nobody there
But don't wanna sleep with a man who is sharing a bed with somebody else
Oh! Here I am, wasting time
I fool myself thinking I do it right
So, ok! It's enough
Don't wanna play your game no more
You can call me night and day but, believe me, there will be no replay
When you need me, forget it
If you miss me, forget about it
If you wanna cry, ok! That's not my fault
It's your turn to feel like a fool
Remember that we played by your rules
Now the game is not so funny, right?
I got to say, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
(I won't play your game no more)

Take You Higher 
I feel like a million bucks, babe, and so should you
I know I could fill you up, babe, if you want me to
I'll give you my body, baby, not just my mind
Don't act like it's complicated, we'll be just fine
I can take you a little bit higher
I can be your one desire
Boy, I'm on to you
I can take you a litte bit higher
I can be your one desire
If you want me to
You think that you're out of luck, babe, you're feeling down (so down)
My shock will be enough babe to turn your fortunes around
(give you my body) Said I'll give you my body (ooh), baby, not just my mind (ooh)
Don't act like its complicated, we'll be just fine
I've been waiting, anticipating for so long
I've been trying to make you feel
Trying to make you feel, trying to make you feel this way

Yes We Can Can 
Now's the time for all good men
To get together with one another
We got to iron out our problems
And iron out our quarrels
And try to live as brothers
And try to find a piece of land
Without stepping on one another
And do respect the women of the world
Remember you all have mothers
We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give
I know we can make it
I know darn well we can work it out
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna get together we can work it out
And we gotta take care of all the children
The little children of the world
'Cause they're our strongest hope for the future
The little bitty boys and girls
We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give
I know we can make it
I know darn well we can work it out
Oh yes we can, I know we can can
Yes we can can, why can't we?
If we wanna, yes we can can

Am I The Same Girl 
Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Whom you hurt so
I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
The one you used to meet
Around the corner every day
We would meet and slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Whom you hurt so
I'm the one you hurt
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one who cried
I'm the one you used to meet
But you are pretending
You don't care
And the fire is still there
But we were no longer too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am

Baby, baby, tell me… Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?

Baby, baby, tell me… Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
You trying to drive me completely away
Forgetting the love we shared just yesterday
But the way you’re acting now
Doesn’t seem to fit somehow
For all I see or seem
It’s just a dream within a dream
I see my baby and he is filled with joy
And he see’s that I’m not filled with his joy
All I hear is laughter, laughter from out there
Baby, baby, tell me… Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
Don’t You Care?
See you baby and you’re filled with joy

With why and how I want to live
You're so rare, man, you're so fine
You know, I'm so glad you're mine
You're so very rare and so fine
I'm sure glad you're mine

When you work your way around
Ain't a part of me leftover
That your sweet love ain't found
You make my, my moan turn to whisper
You make my whisper turn to call
You make me scream and scream that I love you
When you, when you make me rise and fall
You're so rare, and you're so fine
And I'm so very, very, very glad you're mine
You're so rare and so fine
Oh, oh, you're mine, you're mine
You know, you know I want the best for you, baby
And what you want, I want for you
And we can, we can work together, baby
To see it, to see it all come true
'Cause you're so rare, and you're, you're so fine
And Lord knows, I'm so very glad you're mine
You're so rare, so rare, and you're so very, very fine
Oh, you cleared all the questions from my mind
We come a, we come a long, long way together, baby
Through the hard times and all the good
I'm gonna take this day to celebrate you, baby
'Cause I have to stop and praise you like I should
You're so rare, take yo' praise, and you're so fine
And I hope you know I'm glad you're mine
Take yo' praise, you're so rare, take yo' praise, you're so fine
Take yo' praise, I'm glad you're mine

Somebody’s Watching You 
Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture
Witty, witty, witty as you can be
Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free
Ever stop to think about a downfall?
Happens at the end of every line
Just when you think you've pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Games are to be played with toys, et cetera
Love is to be made when you'rе for real
Ups and downs are caused by lifе in general
Some are yours no matter how you feel
Shady as a lady in a moustache
Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon
The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you

Trouble with My Lover 
Sometimes I get lonesome
Sometime I get a little blue
He got me walking around in circles
And after that I don't know what to do
What good is a love
You can't have it when you want it
What good is a love
If you can't own it
Love can be so good
And love can be so cruel
Love can make you happy
Make you blow your cool
But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the little old dark
You know he fill me up with a kind of delight
Ooh, the man's all right
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble (trouble)
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble (trouble)
I feel so helpless
I can't help myself
I don't want to see him no no no no
With nobody else
In the restless hours
I sit home alone
I wished I believe oh yeah
This man I love
But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the little old dark
You know he fill me up with a kind of delight
Hey the man's all right

My Baby Just Cares for Me 
My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
Is somethin' he can't see
My baby don't care who knows
My baby just cares for me
Baby, my baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
He cares for me
My baby don't care
For cars and races
Baby don't care for
He don't care for high-tone places
Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Liberace's smile
Is something he can't see
Is something he can't see
I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for me

Killing Me Softly with His Song 
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
To listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me
As if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
La la la, la la la
Ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh
La ahh ahhhhhh haaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ha ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh ahh
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me (softly)
He was strumming my pain
Yeah, he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

Uptight (Everything’s Alright)
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hanging on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can't buy
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, hahahahaha, yeah
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, way out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of...

Papa's got a brand new bag
Come here, mama
And dig this crazy scene
He's not too fancy
But his line is pretty clean
He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag
He's doing The Jerk
He's doing The Fly
Don't play him cheap
'Cause you know he ain't shy
He's doing The Monkey, The Mashed Potatoes
Jump back Jack, see you later, alligator
Come here, sister
Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip now
But I can dig the new breed thing
He ain't no drag
He's got a brand new bag
Well, Papa, you're doing The Jerk
Papa, he's doing The Jerk
You're doing The Twist, just like this
He's doing The Fly every day and every night
The thing, like The Boomerang
Hey!
Come on, hey hey!
Come on, hey hey!
Said you're uptight, you're out of sight
Come on, see what you know
Come on, see what you know

Superfly 
Darkest of night with the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong; lotta things goin' on
The man of the hour has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Hard to understand what a hell of a man
This cat of the slum had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own but the man lived alone
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
The game he plays, he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' to get over
That's what he tryin' to do, y'all
Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Woo, Super Fly, huh, huh
The aim of his role was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream: what does it mean? He wouldn't know
"Can't be like the rest" is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out and there's no happiness
Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha
Super Fly
Super Fly
Super Fly
Super Fly
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over
Tryin' to get over


Theme from Shaft 
Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
(Shaft)
Ya damn right
Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?
(Shaft)
Can you dig it?
Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?
(Shaft)
Right on
They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother...
(Shut your mouth)
I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft
(Then we can dig it)
He's a complicated man
But no one understands him but his woman
(John Shaft)

War 
(War, huh) Yeah!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, uhuh
(War, huh) Yeah!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Say it again, y'all!
(War, huh) Lookout!
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me, awwwww!
War I despise
'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives
I said
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it again
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me!
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, awwww
War is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest, within the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
Awwww!
(War, huh) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) Oh-ohh yeah, huh
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), It's got one friend, that's the undertaker, awwww
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days
War can't give life, it can only take it away, awwww!
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it
(War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord
(What is it good for?) Oh, absolutely nothing
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker, woooo!
Peace, love and understanding
Tell me, is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows there's gotta be a better way, ooohhh
(War, huh) Good God y'all
(What is it good for?) You tell me, say it, say it, say it, say it
(War, huh) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Stand up and shout it (Nothing)

Ball of Confusion (That’s What the World Is Today) 
One, two
One, two, three, four, ow!
People movin' out, people movin' in
Why? Because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on
Well, the only person talkin' 'bout "Love thy brother"
Is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learnin'
But the teacher
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration Aggravation, humiliation, obligation to our nation
Ball of confusion
Oh, yeah
That's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey
The sale of pills are at an all-time high
Young folks walkin' 'round with their heads in the sky
Cities aflame in the summertime
And oh, the beat goes on
Evolution, revolution, gun control, the sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon, kids growin' up too soon
Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on
So 'round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, said, nobody knows
Oh, Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
Just a ball of confusion
Oh yeah, that's what the world is today
Woo, hey, hey
Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on
Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand, population out of hand
Suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war"
And the band played on
Great Googa Mooga
Can't you hear me talking to you?
It's a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey
Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya
Sayin', ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey, hey (Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let me hear ya)
Sayin', ball of confusion
That's what the world is today

Let the music work your ear muscles
And if you're skinny, then use your little muscles
Bag back, or tea bag with these duffles

Lovely Day 
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
