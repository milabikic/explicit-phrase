Kids in the Dark

The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa (The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)
Whoa, whoa
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, "What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

Shots
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space?
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here
But I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishin' I had
What I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole (Oh, let me make it up to you)
Through every single thing that I loved
(Let me make it up to you)
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away (Let me make it up to you)
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Supermodel
Alone at parties in a deadly silhouette
She loves the cocaine, but cocaine don't love her back
When she's upset, she talks to Maury and takes deep breaths
She's a '90s supermodel, uh-uh-uh
Way back in high school, when she was a good Christian
I used to know her, but she's got a new best friend
A drag queen named The Virgin Mary takes confessions
She's a '90s supermodel
Yeah, she's a master, my compliments
If you wanna love her, just deal with that
She'll never love you more than money and cigarettes
Every night's a heartbreak
Hey, don't think about it, hey, just let it go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll (Hey)
Savor every moment 'til she has to go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock 'n' roll
Alone at parties, she's working around the clock
When you're not looking, she's stealing your Basquiat
Low-waisted pants on OnlyFans, I'll pay for that
She's a '90s supermodel
Yeah, she's a master, my compliments
If you wanna love her, just deal with that
She'll never love you, you just look a bit like her dad
Every night's a heartbreak
Hey, don't think about it, hey, just let it go

Strangers
Maybe I'll just be fucked up forever
Should have figured myself out by now
And I don't wanna tear myself open, no
But it's hard to care when you bleed out
So won't you break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room full of strangers
Well I guess my guardian angel missed the memo
'Cause we're walking on razors again
And we swore to God we'd never let this happen, no
We've dragged ourselves through hell and we'll be damned if we go back
Break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess that I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, it don't
Where did we go?
We're all alone, all alone
No place like home
Take us back to yesterday
S.O.S
Save us from ourselves
We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room, we're just a room
We're just a room full of strangers
Strangers

All the Things I Hate About You 
Haha
Take a bow
You've got everybody fooled, I got you figured out
Now you’re choking on your words, well, you should spit it out
Know that I gave you the world and you just gave me hell
And you gave me hell
Felt like a hundred punches
Too many tough pills to stomach
I watched you making it public
Lights, camera, fuck it
You're a showstopper
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about you
(All the things I hate about you)
You could’ve had a rockstar
But you chose up on a bum-star
Bootleg version of me, that's your loss
Had to find out through a photo
Hangin' on your arm like a knockoff
Stab me in the back like nothing
Never even saw this comin'
I watched you making it public
Lights, camera, fuck it
You're a showstopper
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about you
You won't break me again and say it's all in my head
Holdin’ his hand in that dress from the night that you left
I’m so sick of the pain, I'll never see you the same
Guess that’s the price that you pay for the mess that you made
You're a showstopper (Let's go)
A bad liar, homie-hopper, drama-starter
All my friends are fucked, we all got you in common (Okay)
You're so fake and everyone should know about it
And all the things I hate about you (Yeah)
All the things I hate about you, yeah
All the things I hate about the way you manipulate me (Yeah)
Left me with no explanation
Every word is true, all the things I hate about—
Every single thing about you

Pass The Nirvana 
Yeah
Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear
Suicide season is upon and high
Why you always saying, "Let the good times roll"?
Kick your mind open like a punk rock show
Uppercut, bleeding through a softened nose
If you didn't come home injured, would you say it was a good show?
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tеnsion
Through the tension, right now
This is only a distraction
Swing, batter up, lеt's play
Power until the target bleeds
This gun would never turn on me
So, Paul Meany, will you drop that beat
Why you always saying, "Let that shit go"?
Pennywise fashion on a sad skid row
A gentrified neighborhood of blood-soaked homes
Draw the lines a little further, now they're coming back to get you
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
Yo, I can't shine to save my life
But I'll feel through the dark without you
I set fires ablaze inside
And stepped into the light to blind you
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
I can't hear you

​Maybe 
That's hard
Two, three, five
Maybe if I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There's shadows on the wall, wish I would've ran (Yeah)
Gotta get away, I hope you understand
I try to hide my face like a wanted man (Yeah)
Maybe I'll be gone before you count to ten
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking thе last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm rеady to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last
Maybe if we went another way (Another way)
I wouldn't be regretting the decisions that I made
I don't want to spend another day (Another day)
Looking for somebody that I know I can't replace
My tears fall, you don't miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history
I think I'm broke and nothing can fix me
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last
Yeah (Maybe)
We were built to fall apart
But I can't feel you now
And it's too late now, there's no point screaming
Dug your grave, so fuck your feelings
No one's here, so now you're on your own
Made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last

Black Summer 
A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon
(Hit me now)
Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew (Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton, the archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun
It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on anothеr black summer to end
It's been a long time and you nеver know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
Crack the flaming whip, a-sailin' on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip
Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end

San Quentin 
Let's get this circus on down the road
We're takin' bets how far a tank of gas will go
Call up your best friend, then call two more
About to do some shit that you ain't seen before
There ain't no backdoor, there ain't no sign
Location changes almost every other night
Last time we found it, can't remember much
I thought I was a God until my lawyer woke me up and said I
Testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Got out on bail, we hit the town
Somebody told me we should burn it to the ground
Too many favors, too much to drink
Come 6 AM, they had me back inside the clink
I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?
Tough to find, a goddamn alibi
Wrong or right, it's tough to justify
Can't dismiss, too many witnesses
When insanity's the pattern, it don't matter what it is
I'm gonna testify that I was right out of my mind
Let the record show I did it all for rock and roll
Screamin' every night, playing 25 to Life
So somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin
Out of San Quentin
Oh, just keep me out of San Quentin
Ooh, can somebody please keep me the hell out of San Quentin?

Face It Alone 
When something so near and dear to life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul is set on fire
When something so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside
Your cries can be heard
So loud and clear
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it all alone
When something so dear to your life
Explodes inside
You feel your soul is burned alive (Burned alive)
When somethin’ so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside
Your cries can be heard
So loud and clear
Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it alone
When the moon has lost its glow
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da, da, da, da-doh
When the moon has
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da, da, da, da-doh
When the moon
When the moon has lost its glow
You have to face it all alone

Sweet Child O’ Mine 
She's got a smile that it seems, to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then, when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry
Woah-woah-woah
Sweet child of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
Woah-oh-woah
Sweet child of mine
Ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sweet love of mine
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Mm-mm, oh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Oh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Sweet child)
Mm-huh, where do we go now?
Ah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-oh (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Ooh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-oh, wow
Where do we go?
Oh-oh, where do we go now?
(Oh) Where do we go, oh-oh-oh-oh? (Oh, wow)
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Woah-oh, where do we go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Sweet child
Sweet child of mine

Gimme Shelter 
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, yeah
Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red-coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way
War, children, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children,yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Hey, hey
Rape, murder
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder, yeah
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder (Woo)
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Yeah
Mmm, the flood is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, (kiss away, kiss away)

Back in Black 
Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Creep
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

Detroit Rock City 
...Congressional reports
President Ford says that he's disappointed
With Congress's performance
In Detroit, a Pontiac, Michigan youth
Was reported dead at the scene of
A head-on collision on Grand Avenue this morning
He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard When he struck a delivery truck
And was catapulted through the windshield of his car
The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured
The identities of both men are being withheld by local police
County legislatures today are expected to rally
To the aid of striking longshoremen
In hopes of ending the nine-month deadlock...
"..Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day..."
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio, it goes
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why?
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Get up


Livin’ on a Prayer 
Once upon a time, not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer
Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Wish You Were Here 
And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes, now which is it?
I am sure of it
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

Everlong 
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head, she sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when

Something in the Way
Underneath the bridge, tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped, have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass, and the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm

Basket Case 
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?
And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah
(Ooh, ooh)
Grasping to control
So I better hold on
Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?

Carry On Wayward Son 
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more, no
Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
But surely heaven waits for you
Carry on, my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry, don't you cry no more
No more

Born in the U.S.A. 
Born down in a dead man's town
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
You end up like a dog that's been beat too much
'Til you spend half your life just coverin' up
Born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
Born in the U.S.A. 
Got in a little hometown jam
So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man
Born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. 
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man says, "Son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, "Son, don't you understand"
I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go
Born in the U.S.A. 
I was born in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A. 
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A. 
Born in the U.S.A. 
Born in the U.S.A. 
I'm a cool rockin' Daddy in the U.S.A. now

You know, every now and then

Nice and easy but there's just one thing
You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy
We always do it nice and rough

Zombie 
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra

I Love Rock ’N Roll
I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he musta been about 17
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
'Til he was with me, yeah, me, singin'
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time and dance with me
He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name
"That don't matter," he said, "'cause it's all the same"
Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
And next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah, me, singin'
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby

Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"

Hit Me with Your Best Shot 
Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
That's okay, let's see how you do it
Put up your dukes, let's get down to it
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
You come on with it, come on, you don't fight fair

Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me

Just a Girl 
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand
'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights
Oh, I've had it up to here
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear
'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype
Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be
Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to here

Hey Hey
You've got to listen the guitars
Yes i can feel it in my blood
The taste of old good rock n roll
The alcohol
You got to lose your boring side
Let out your devil stay alive
Just try to prove this tasty sin
And let me in
Hey hey
The motherfuckers want to turn it off
Hey hey
But there is nothing to make us stop
Hey hey
Turn loud the music baby
And i will bring this down
You got to lose your own control
Just come with me in ecstasy
Feel the vibration in your bones
Don’t be strong as stone
You got to kiss my flaming soul
Forget your proud take off your clothes
Just keep on dancing to the beat
Scream, baby, scream 

Adrenaline
Feel the adrenaline chasing through your veins
Gotta love the attention
I wanna feel the energy rising
I wanna feel this bass drum pounding
Through your skin, you take to the night
Like thunder and lightning
Let's own this night
Just you and me, boy
Let me hear you scream
Hey...
Hey...
I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet
Take take take me anywhere you want me
I wanna feel you play
With my heart
Grasp anything you want
I love to feel this pain
Hey...
Ooh...
I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You lookеd over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet
I can't hеlp but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet!
I can't help but feel like this is wrong
But I fell down
Right to my knees
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard
Right at your feet
I can't help but feel...
You looked over with your dirty smile
And I fell hard!
At your feet

Because the Night 
Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust

Mayhem 
He said he didn’t even hear trains let alone the few words
The ladies maybe sayin’ about him
She freaks and tells her closest friend that she’ll never love again
But she’ll never, no not ever
Live without him
Wouldn’t believe it, if you seen it
Oh, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta Mayhem, woh oh oh yeah
She said he didn’t mean a thing so she threw her diamond ring
Out the window of a black cab in Camden
He couldn’t take it, what she did
So he threw a hissy fit and he took it out on anyone at random
Wouldn’t believe it, if you seen it
Oh, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
Yeah, Mayhem doo doo doop
A lotta Mayhem, woh oh oh yeah
Dinning sound, lights spinning round, some mothers’ son
Gotta fight or got to run run run run
Run run run run run
Ten pints and then he starts a fight and he lands himself a night
In a cell wearing grey pants and bruises
Twelve mates bangin’ on the door, oh the back up vans galore
Never saw such a street full of losers

Drugstore Rock and Roll 
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
Drugstore on the corner of main
That's where you find all the bebop gang
The girls fill the jukebox and then demand
The jitterbug hand-in-hand
The boys have crew-cuts under their hats
The girls have leather sweaters, real cool cats
They're always together happy an' hep
Jumpin' to a rock 'n' roll step
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop

Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll
The records have a slow beat, a fast beat too
As long as they're rockin' any beat will do
Kittens gettin' groovy all over the floor
And the cats are cryin' for more
Take time out for a soda pop
Dig a new record with a lot of bop
Ice cream cones and banana split
Ten jumps ahead of a fit
Drugstore's rockin', rock-rock
Couples are boppin', bop-bop
Jukebox jumpin', jump-jump
Feet keep thumpin', thump-thump
Drugstore's real gone man
Rock-bop-jump-thump, rock 'n' roll

Stay High 
I already feel like doing it again, honey
'Cause once you know, then you know
And you don't wanna go
Back to wherever it is that you come from, yeah
I just want to stay high with you
'Cause where I come from
Everybody frowns and walks around
With that ugly thing on their face
And where I come from
We work hard and grind and hustle all day
(Yes, we do)
There comes a time, there comes a time
At night where we get to play
And we smile and laugh and jump and clap
And yell and holler and just feel great
I just want to stay high with you
With you, with you, baby
So don't question my state of mind
I'm doing wonderful, just fine, thank you
(Thank you)
Everything is everything and everything is beautiful
(How did you get like that?)
See, all I do is keep it cool and don't worry 'bout what everyone is doing
I already feel like doing it again, honey
I just want to stay high
I just want to stay high
I just want to stay high with you

Still into You 
Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time, I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)
I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you

Sk8er Boi 
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
I see the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'm with the skater boy (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I said, "See you later, boy" (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be backstage after the show (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be at our studio (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Singin' the song we wrote (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
About a girl you used to know (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'm with the skater boy (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I said, "See you later, boy" (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll be backstage after the show (Yeah-yeah-yeah)

Singin' the song we wrote (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
About a girl you used to know

Wicked partnership in this crime
Ripping off the best
Condescending smile
Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth
Go on, tease me
Clock is ticking while I'm stealing time
Can't you turn it back?
Stop the cycle, set it free and run away
Silent sneaking along my path
Rugged the road but we
Feel it like we're flyin'
(Feel it like we're flyin'...)
Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth

Kiss Me Deadly 
I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid
I got in a fight
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
Late for my job
And the traffic was bad
Had to borrow ten bucks from my old man
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
I went to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story
It'd be alright

Nothing to eat and no TV
Looking in the mirror
Don't get it for me
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing
But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like

Seether 
Ow!
Seether is neither loose nor tight
Seether is neither black nor white
I tried to keep her on a short leash
I tried to calm her down
I tried to ram her into the ground, yeah
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Seether is neither big nor small
Seether is the center of it all
I tried to rock her in my cradle
I tried to knock her out
I tried to cram her back in my mouth, yeah
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
Can't fight the seether
I can't see her till I'm foaming at the mouth
Keep her down, boiling water
Keep her down, what a lovely daughter
Oh, she is not born like other girls
But I know how to conceive her
Oh, she may not look like other girls
But she's a snarl-toothed seether, seether!
Can't fight the seether

Lucky Lips 
When I was just a little girl with long and silky curls
My mama told me: "Honey, you got more than other girls!
Now you may not be good looking, but you'll soon wear diamond clips
And you'll never have to worry, 'cause you've got lucky lips!"
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true!
I don't need a four-leave clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!
(With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!)
I never get heartbroken, no, I never get the blues
And if I play the game of love, I know I just can't lose
When they spin that wheel of fortune, all I do is kiss my chips
And I know I'm picked a winner, 'cause I've got lucky lips!
And I know I'm bound to win, yeah, 'cos I've got lucky lips!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips that will be true!
I don't need a four-leave clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!
With lucky lips I'll always have a fellow in my arm!

When Will I Be Loved 
I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
I've been made blue
I've been lied to
When will I be loved?
When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time
Oh, I've been cheated
Been mistreated
When will I be loved?

I Can’t Make You Love Me 
Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

Fade Into You 
I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take the breath that's true
I look to you when I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colored your eyes with what's not there
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew
