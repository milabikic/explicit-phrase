Stand by Me 
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
And darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Whoa, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me
Darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Whoa, just stand now
Oh, stand, stand by me

Uptight (Everything’s Alright)
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, out of sight
I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks
The only shirt I own is hanging on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can't buy
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, hahahahaha, yeah
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, way out of sight
Baby, everything is all right, uptight, clean out of...

Sunny 
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Now the dark days are done and the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
And now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you, thank you
For that gleam that flows with grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet, complete desire
Sunny one so true, yes, I love you
Sunny, yesterday, oh, my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really, really eased the pain
Now the dark days are done and the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true
I love you, I love you
I love you, babe, I love you...

Am I The Same Girl 
Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Whom you hurt so
I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
The one you used to meet
Around the corner every day
We would meet and slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Why don't you stop (stop)
And look me over
(Look me over)
Am I the same girl
You used to know
Why don't you stop (stop)
And think it over
(Think it over)
Am I the same girl
Whom you hurt so
I'm the one you hurt
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one who cried
I'm the one you used to meet
But you are pretending
You don't care
And the fire is still there
But we were no longer too young
To love each other this way
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am
Am I the same girl
Yes, I am, yes, I am

Trouble with My Lover 
Sometimes I get lonesome
Sometime I get a little blue
He got me walking around in circles
And after that I don't know what to do
What good is a love
You can't have it when you want it
What good is a love
If you can't own it
Love can be so good
And love can be so cruel
Love can make you happy
Make you blow your cool
But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the little old dark
You know he fill me up with a kind of delight
Ooh, the man's all right
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble (trouble)
(Trouble with my lover)
I'm in a world of trouble (trouble)
I feel so helpless
I can't help myself
I don't want to see him no no no no
With nobody else
In the restless hours
I sit home alone
I wished I believe oh yeah
This man I love
But when he puts his arms around me
Way in the little old dark
You know he fill me up with a kind of delight
Hey the man's all right

Jackson Ain’t a Very Big Town
Tonight at night we get married my friends all say it's a shame and disgrace
And he's loved every woman in Jackson oh but Jackson ain't a very big place
Tomorrow we'll go walking I count each one with a tear on her face
Then I'll know just how many think I'm lucky cause Jackson ain't a very big place
Jackson is a mighty small town where the gossips and the rumors go round
But the gossips are the ones he turned down and Jackson ain't a very big town
Jackson is a mighty small town

Back in Baby’s Arms
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Don't know why we quarrel
We never did before
Since we found out how it hurt
I bet we never quarrel anymore
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Thought I didn't need his love
Till he took it away
Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay
I'm back in baby's arms
How I miss those loving arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms
Back in baby's arms

Promises, Promises
You've promised you would be true to me but we both know you could never be
You've been puttin' you on since the day we met
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Then you promised me a ring a weddin' gown and all of them things
But I ain't seen no diamond yet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met you break my heart in two again I'll bet
But promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
And now you tell me you've gone away you swear to me that this time you'll stay
But I can't believe that I'm rid of you yet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met you break my heart in two again I'll bet
Promises promises that's all I ever get that's all I ever get
Promises promises that's all I get
All you gave me since the day we met...
